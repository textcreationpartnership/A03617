            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the ſoule of a man can partake of the benefits of Chriſt, two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Firſt, that the ſoule bee prepared for Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the ſoule bee implanted into Chriſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning preparation, there hath beene two doctrines handled out of <hi>Luke,</hi> 1.17. The firſt of which, That the ſoule of a poore ſinner muſt bee prepared
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4393:4"/>for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, before it can receive him, and comfort from him. The ſecond doctrine was, That a powerfull Miniſtry is the ordinary meanes that the Lord hath appointed to prepare the ſoule of a poore ſinner ſoundly for Chriſt. Now we are to proceede in this preparation, and in the handling of this generall preparation, two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, the generall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that pertaine to preparation: And ſecondly, the ſubſtantiall parts of preparation. For the generall circumſtances which are moſt remarkeable in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, they are twofold; ſome on Gods part, and theſe are, Firſt, the freeneſſe of the offer of his grace. Secondly, the univerſality of this offer of grace, <hi>To all.</hi> And thirdly, the eaſineſſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereupon he offereth it, <hi>Whoſoever will may receive it, and that freely.</hi> On mans part, two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, he muſt conſider that his owne corruption doth oppoſe this grace of God. And ſecondly, he muſt conſider, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to worke this grace in man, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way man as corruption which oppoſeth the ſame. So that there bee five things conſiderable in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">Five things in Prepatation.</note> as generall circumſtances thereof, before we come to the ſubſtantiall parts of it. The firſt is this,<note n="1" place="margin">1.</note> namely, <hi>That the offer of grace, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to his,<note n="2" place="margin">2.</note> and will worke in his is free.</hi> Secondly, the condition of grace and Gods offer is this, <hi>That a man muſt will to receive Chriſt and grace, before hee can receive Chriſt and grace.</hi>
                  <note n="3" place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that doth truly will to receive Chriſt and grace, ſhall have Chriſt and grace.</hi>
                  <note n="4" place="margin">4.</note> And fourthly, <hi>That no man of himſelfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4393:4"/>can will that hee may receive Chriſt.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>That God will work a will in his ſervants to receive the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note n="5" place="margin">5.</note> and then hee will beſtow him upon them.</hi> And theſe are the five paſſages which are generall circumſtances of preparation. And three of theſe points which are the three firſt, we have in this text, <hi>Every man that will let him take freely of the water of life;</hi> here is the free offer of Gods mercy and goodneſſe. Here alſo we ſee that a man muſt will Chriſt and grace before hee can have Chriſt. And thirdly, that he that doth truly will Chriſt ſhall have him, and grace and ſalvation by him.</p>
               <p>Wee will open a word or two in the text, and ſo proceede. Firſt, wee muſt ſee what is meant here by <hi>water.</hi> Secondly, what is meant by <hi>water of life.</hi> Firſt, what is meant by <hi>water:</hi> by water is meant here the Spirituall grace of God, together with the immediate aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſame upon the ſoule of man.</p>
               <p>In <hi>water</hi> here wee may conclude two things, not onely the grace which God doth convey to the ſoules of his people, but alſo the aſſiſtance of the Spirit working the ſame in the ſoule; looke for the truth of this, the 7. of <hi>Iohn</hi> 38, 39. <hi>He that beleeveth on me</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>as the Scripture ſaith, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> Now what are theſe <hi>waters</hi> here ſpoken of; in the next <hi>verſe</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>This ſpoke our Saviour of the Spirit, which they that beleeved on him ſhould receive from him,</hi> that is, the working aſſiſtance of his Spirit. So that we ſee in this place of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> this phraſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4393:5"/>and ſo the 4. of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 10. <hi>verſe,</hi> the like phraſe is uſed. There our Saviour replieth to the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> after this manner. <hi>If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, give me to drinke, Thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> And ſo in the 14 <hi>verſ. Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> That is, hee that receiveth the grace of Gods Spirit, and the aſſiſtance thereof, <hi>It ſhall be a well of water to him, ſpringing up into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Hence it is that Chriſt is called, <hi>The fountaine of the garden:</hi> and <hi>a well of living water, Can.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.14. He is called, <hi>The fountaine of living waters; My people</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the fountaine of living waters, and have hewen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Ciſternes, even broken Ciſternes that can hold no water.</hi> So that Chriſt Ieſus is the fountaine; the grace of God are the rivers, and the operation of the Spirit, as the ſtreames, <hi>which make glad the City of God:</hi> or elſe, Chriſt is the Conduit, the graces of God the cocke, and the operation of the Spirit is the drawer of the water which comes into the ſoules of his ſervants. So that we ſee plainly, that by water is meant the graces of Gods Spirit, which God is pleaſed to convey and worke in the ſoules of his ſervants. The ſecond phraſe in the text is <hi>water of life:</hi> and wee muſt ſee what is meant by that, it is as much as if a man ſhould ſay quickning grace: and that is ſaid to be <hi>the water of life</hi> in two regards,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4393:5"/>Firſt, becauſe it is that which begets a ſpirituall life in us; a man is dead without the Lord Ieſus, and the graces of his Spirit, <hi>Without me you can doe nothing,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: but looke as it is with the graft which is out of the Stocke, it proſpereth not, nor bringeth forth fruite, but withereth away; So thoſe that are not engrafted into Chriſt, which have not the power of Chriſt to aſſiſt them, they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes; but when this grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes, it is a lively grace, and a quickning Spirit; it begets life in the ſoule of a man. In the 47 of <hi>Ezech. verſ.</hi> 9. the Prophet there diſcovering the time of the Goſpell, and the offer of ſalvation therein, he ſaith there, <hi>Every thing ſhall live whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this river commeth:</hi> The rivers there are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the rivers of grace and ſalvation; when Chriſt ſhall come, abundance of grace ſhall be offered and wrought in the ſoules of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and whereſoever this grace commeth, thoſe that be dead ſhall be quickned. Secondly, they are ſaid to bee <hi>waters of life,</hi> in regard of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, for whereſoever this grace is truly wrought, it never ceaſeth; ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> This water is not like a pit or ſtanding poole, that in the heate of ſummer is dryed up, but it runneth amaine continually. So that the frame of the words runne thus; Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will, let him come and take living water, living and quickning grace from Ieſus Chriſt freely, whereby a ſoule may be quickned and ſaved: here
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4393:6"/>is a proclamation, <hi>Whoever will, let him come, and take the Lord Chriſt, and grace and ſalvation by him freely,</hi> he will not repine at the favour he vouchſafes unto us; take more hope, more faith, more ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; come, and come freely, and the more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener ye come, the more welcome ſhal you be: This is the ſubſtance of the words in the text; wherein wee have theſe three points formerly ſpoken of. Firſt, here wee have the freeneſſe of Gods mercy, <hi>Whoever will, let him take of the water of life freely:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, ſhall any man bring money with him and buy grace? no, no, let him take the Spirit freely. Secondly, <hi>A man muſt will Chriſt, before he can receive Chriſt and grace from him,</hi> and this is the ſecond thing in the text. The third is, <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that doth truly will Christ and grace, ſhall have Chriſt and grace from him.</hi> Men thinke that they would be ſaved, every man will be ready to ſay, I would have Chriſt rule in me, but this ſame willing of Chriſt is a hard matter; whoſoever doth will heartily to receive Chriſt, ſhall have him and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him: but wee ſhall finde it a hard matter to bring our hearts to this willing of Chriſt, as wee ſhall here hereafter; and thus wee ſee the three points that ariſe out of the text, and by this time we are entred into our worke, let us proceede with the purſuite of the firſt point, which is this, <hi>The offer of grace from God is altogether free.</hi> There is nothing but onely Gods will that moves him, nothing but his owne good pleaſure that perſwades him to ſhew mercy to a poore ſoule, there is nothing out of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4393:6"/>God that can move him, or purchaſe this favour from him, but it is from out of the goodneſſe of his nature, and the freeneſſe of his will, he will have it ſo. In the 21 of the <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. there is a marvelous pregnant place for this purpoſe, there ſaith the text, <hi>I will give unto him that is a thirſt, of the fountaine of the water of life freely.</hi> There are three things or phraſes conſiderable. Firſt, God will give him to drinke, and what is freer than gift; nay, that we may know that he will not give it us upon any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will give it freely; nay, marke further, hee will give it to every one that thirſteth: though a man deſireth it earneſtly, even as a man that is a thirſt deſireth drinke, though he doe what he can to obtaine it, though hee uſe all meanes for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, yet God will give it him, and that freely; and this cuts the throates of merit-mongers the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that ſtand ſo much upon their merits, and therefore it is obſerveable in the 4. of <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.9. in the building of the materiall Temple, the text ſaith, <hi>That Zerubbabels hands which had layd the foundation thereof, ſhould finiſh it.</hi> The ſame hand which layd the firſt ſtone, ſo the ſame hand ſhould lay the laſt: the meaning of the place is this; when the poore people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to build the Temple in time of perſecution, they had no ability of themſelves to do it, yet the Lord bids them go on cheerefully, for I will diſpoſe of all things, <hi>for the gold and ſilver is mine:</hi> and hereby the Lord doth quippe at a ſecret <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>babell that hath layd the firſt ſtone, ſhall bring forth the headſtone thereof,</hi> and what is the ground of all this, the reaſon is rendered in the 7. <hi>verſ. All the people ſhall cry grace, grace;</hi> as if they had ſaid, Grace hath ſent meanes, grace hath continued means, grace hath given us hearts to uſe the means, all is grace, nothing but grace and mercy hath done it; thus the people admired at Gods great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that did ſo helpe them, and ſhouted crying, grace, grace: And as it was thus in the materiall Temple, ſo it is here in the building of the ſoule a Temple for the Lord. The beginning of grace, the receiving of grace, the continuing of grace, all is grace grace: from the beginning of election, to the end of glorification; from the beginning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, to the end of ſalvation, all is grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; nothing but grace that doth all, workes all, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares all for the good of Gods people. Gods grace and mercy is altogether free, and the freedome of it appeareth in theſe three particulars. It is free, Firſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nregard of the preparation of the meanes of grace that God hath invented; the meanes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which God hath invented for his people being fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> was altogether free, for when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had forſaken God and hearkned to the enemy, had left the way of holineſſe, and went into the way of confuſion, it was free with God whither he would helpe him or no; when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſpent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4393:7"/>the patrimony which God had given him, it was free whether God would ſet him up againe or no, free it was in God the Father, which appointed the Sonne as the meanes; free it was in Chriſt Ieſus, that tooke the taske upon him; and free in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, that wrought grace and ſalvation in the hearts of Gods people; God out of his free will gave his Sonne to redeeme mankinde, and Chriſt gave himſelfe freely, and the holy Ghoſt doth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke comfort in the hearts of Gods choſen: it was free with God to appoint Chriſt for the meanes, free with Chriſt to be the meanes, free with the Spirit to worke the meanes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is free in regard of the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the meanes, ſo likewiſe in regard of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the meanes to any ſoule, it was free with God, whether he would enlighten any mans eyes, and bring Salvation unto him; why doth God raine upon one Citty and not upon another? that is, why doth the dew of the Goſpell raine upon one place, and not upon another? it is for nothing but becauſe it is Gods will it ſhould be ſo; in the 4 of <hi>Luke</hi> the 25. the place is very pregnant for this purpoſe, <hi>There</hi> ſaith the text <hi>many widdowes were in Iſrael, in the dayes of Elias, when the heavens were ſhut up three yeares and ſixe moneths, but to none of them was Elias ſent, ſave unto Sarepta a City of Sidon, unto a woman which was a widdow;</hi> and this was onely out of Gods free grace: he may take the meanes from one man, and give it to another, he may ſend his Goſpell and the meanes of Salvation to one

               <p>Thirdly, it appeares in the bleſſing of the meanes, it is in the free mercy of God, that any meanes of Grace and Salvation are bleſſed unto men, and that they worke upon the ſoules of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. there ſaith the text, <hi>after that in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, the world by wiſedome knew not God, it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4393:8"/>pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching, to ſave them that beleeve:</hi> how comes it to paſſe, that men beleeve and are ſaved? why? it is becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, it is not becauſe men could procure this, but it is of Gods meere good will, of his free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy; and this was the cauſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſts great thankeſ-giving, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.25, 26. many poore ſoules were converted by the Preaching of his Apoſtles, and therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I thanke thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt reveal'd them unto babes, even ſo father, for it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> the reaſon why God did this, was becauſe it was his good pleaſure; ſo then the point ſtandeth faire, in regard of explication; Namely that the offer of grace is free, free in regard of the meanes that God hath appointed free in regard of the Revelation of the means appointed, free in regard of the bleſſing of the meanes revealed. But you will ſay, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this? by what argument can you proove that the offer of grace is thus free? The reaſons briefely are three: Firſt, this offer of grace muſts needes be free, becauſe there is nothing in man that can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this, in the 8 of the <hi>Acts</hi> 19.20. when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> ſaw that the Apoſtles by laying on of hands conveyed the grace of the Spirit into mens ſoules, he thought to have gotten a booty, and have done ſo alſo, and offered money, that he might receive that gift, but marke how Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tooke him up with indignation, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4393:9"/>thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with money, thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter.</hi> It was a marvelous fearefull ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, bad him pray that if it were posſible, the thought of his heart might bee forgiven him.</hi> It is a vaine thing to conceive, and a great ſinne to thinke or imagine, that grace can be purchaſed from God by any thing that we have received; for there muſt be ſome proportion betweene the price, and the thing that is bought in common reaſon, but in the 3. of the <hi>Prov.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Merchandize of Wiſedome</hi> (that is, of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, wrought by the Spirit of God) <hi>is better than the Merchandize of ſilver, and the gaine thereof than fine gold, ſhee is more pretious than Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and all the things thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared unto her.</hi> There is no proportion between any thing and this wiſedome; no, no; they that thinke that God loves them any whit the better, becauſe they are rich and learned, and honourable, let them know, that all thoſe things are dung in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the graces of Gods Spirit. If any thinke to buy grace they ſhall periſh, and their money with them; for the offer of grace is free.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, as there is nothing that can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe grace, ſo wee can do nothing that can merit grace, for ſome man may ſay; however I have no money to purchaſe it, yet I can worke it out, as poore men uſe to ſay to thoſe for whom they worke, when they would have any commodity of them, they tell them they have no money to pay
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4393:9"/>them for it, but they will worke it out by their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy labour. But alaſſe, there is nothing that can bee done of the ſinfull ſonne of man, that can procure any thing from God this way, as we may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> It is not our willing, our working, our running, what ever wee have, or can doe, is nothing for the procuring of grace in this kinde; it is God alone that ſheweth mercy. <hi>Thus he will have mercy on whom hee will have mercy, and compasſion on whom hee will have compasſion, and whom he will he hardneth, Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>If thou ſhouldeſt marke what is done amiſſe,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>David) who could abide it.</hi> If God ſhould enter into judgement with any poore ſoule upon the earth, there were no living for him, hee could expect nothing but death, and the fierce anger of God continually to purſue him; and therefore farre it is from man to have any thing that can procure grace at the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man naturally hath no ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he can challenge this by way of promiſe from the Lord, no naturall man hath any promiſe in this kind, <hi>The promiſes are Yea and Amen, to them that are in Chriſt;</hi> to them that are called, and converted and brought home to Chriſt, to thoſe they are all, <hi>yea,</hi> confirmed; and <hi>amen,</hi> concluded; <hi>yea,</hi> made; and <hi>amen,</hi> performed: but a man by nature can claime nothing at Gods hands but hell and damnation, and therefore all the plagues and puniſhments that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall wicked men, are the fruits of their owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4393:10"/>they are their owne, they have the fruit of their owne tree; ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to goe to his owne place.</hi> In the 3. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> the 9. there ſaith the text, <hi>Woe unto the wicked, for they have rewarded evill to their owne ſoules, the reward of their hands ſhall bee giver them, for they ſhall eate the fruite of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> They can challenge confuſion and everlaſting deſtruction, this is their owne; <hi>Iudas</hi> went to his owne, hee had his owne ſhare, and his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation, they were his owne, his owne ſinnes procured them: but as for the obtaining of Chriſt, and of grace and ſalvation, there is nothing that can doe it, it is of the free mercy and goodneſſe of God <hi>Godlineſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s great gaine,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>it hath the promiſe of this life, and of the life to come:</hi> but an ungodly man there is no promiſe at all made unto him, hee can challenge nothing from God by way of promiſe, ſo that by this time wee have the proofe of the point; namely, <hi>That the offer of grace is altogether free:</hi> for we have nothing can purchaſe grace, wee can do nothing that can procure grace, wee have no right whereby wee may challenge grace by way of promiſe naturally, and therefore the caſe is cleare, <hi>That we have grace freely from the hand of God.</hi> We ſee the point cleared, the doctrine confirmed and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The uſe of it is two fold, partly to the Saints of God that have received grace: partly to thoſe that want grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the Saints of God that have received grace, I beſeech you thinke of it, it is a truth that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4393:10"/>cannot be denied, proved by reaſon ſtrong, and Scripture plaine; that whatſoever wee have from the beginning of converſion, to the end of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is free grace. Why, mee thinkes your hearts ſhould anſwer, we ought to be ſtirred up, the more to magnifie the mercy of God, and ſo much the more to bee thankefull unto him for this mercy which our poore ſoules have received at his hands: the freer the grace of God is which hee offereth unto us, the greater our thankſgiving, the greater the acknowledgement of the goodneſſe of the Lord ought to bee: thoſe whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any aſſurance of ſound grace; that Chriſt is there, that ſalvation is there, they doe not know how much beholding they are to God for the ſame, for this proceedeth altogether of his free mercy, looke up therefore unto God, and bleſſe God for it, this is that which did drive the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> to a ſtand, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.18, 19. there faith he, <hi>Who is a Godlike unto our God, that pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iniquities, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſsion of the remnant of his people, he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy, he will turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he will have compaſsion upon us, he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4393:13"/>that have no money, and buy without money:</hi> What is the meaning of this, that is, you that have no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to procure grace and ſalvation, though you have no ability of your ſelves to purchaſe this, yet come and come freely, and <hi>buy without money,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, If you will but come and take grace, this is all God lookes for, all that the Lord expects and deſires, you may have it for the taking, you may receive grace for the carrying of it away, though your weakneſſe be great, and your infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties many, yet if you have but ability to take grace and carry it away, this is enough, this is all that God requires at your hands; and this is that which makes the Saints of God in the 14. of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. to goe unto God, and renounce all others, there ſaith the text, <hi>A ſhur ſhall not ſave us, wee will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the workes of our hands, Ye are our gods;</hi> and what is the ground of all this, <hi>for with thee, the fatherleſſe findeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> ſo that, haſt thou a deſolate ſoule, why, bee of good comfort, and be incouraged to go to God for helpe, for hee doth not ſuccour men becauſe they have ſtrength, but hee helpeth thoſe that are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courleſſe.</p>
               <p>Art thou fatherleſſe, and caſt off of the world; haſt thou a fatherleſſe ſoule, a motherleſſe ſoule; that is, a hopeleſſe and a helpeleſſe ſoule, that hath no ability to procure mercy, or to purchaſe grace; why, with God the fatherleſſe findeth mercy; and therefore ſay, Lord, with thee the fatherleſſe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mercy, I am ſuch a one, therefore Lord I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4393:13"/>mercy from thee. If a great rich man ſhould proclaime, that at ſuch a time every one that will come, may receive dole from him; if this dole now were to bee purchaſed with money, none but the rich could receive it, but when he ſaith he will give to every one that comes a dole freely, then the poore may have it as well as the rich, when the dole commeth not to be purchaſed, but onely to be received, then the begger may have it as well as he that hath money, for the dole is not to bee bought, but to bee received, and therefore every one that hath but a bagge to put it in, and ability to carry it away, may have it; conſider this ye that God hath not called home, there is a dole of mercy to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you from God, and God doth not intend to ſell his mercy to you, but to beſtow it freely upon you, and therefore if you will but come &amp; receive it, and carry it away, you may have it, God requirs nothing elſe of you; and therefore comfort your ſelves and ſay, Why, this mercy of God is free, others have it, and why not I Lord. Come therefore and waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in his ordinances, thinke with thy ſelfe that the dole of mercy is to be given at ſuch a place, at ſuch a ſermon, and therefore reſolve to goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, If wiſedome, or goodneſſe, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, would purchaſe any thing at Gods hand, then miſerable creature that I were, for I have none of thoſe, but the mercy of God is free, there is a dole of mercy freely to be given, and ſuch and ſuch have had it beſtowed upon them, and therefore why may not I have it as well as others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4393:14"/>naturall men that are burthened with abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and full of ſinne and corruptions, let them reaſon with their ſoules, and ſay, Why, did God convert <hi>Saul,</hi> call <hi>Abraham,</hi> and humble <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> why? God did this freely, of his free mercy and goodneſſe, did hee? and why then may not I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this mercy from the hand of the Lord alſo? and when your owne weakeneſſes trouble you, and your ſinnes and infirmities lye ſore upon you, why, then helpe your owne ſoules in this kinde, and ſay, I can doe nothing that can procure grace, no more could <hi>David,</hi> I have nothing that can purchaſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and mercy at Gods hands, no more had <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet God was mercifull to them: why, hee is as mercifull now as he was then, his goodneſſe is not diminiſhed, nor his mercy abated. Lord thou that ſhewedſt mercy to theſe, ſhew mercy to mee alſo; thou that didſt bleſſe theſe Lord, bleſſe mee, even me alſo. Lord thou beſtoweſt thy mercy freely, I beſeech thee therefore beſtow one drop upon my poore ſoule. Aye, but ſome may cavill now and ſay, Gods mercy is free, and therefore hee may as well deny it mee as beſtow it upon mee. I anſwer, this is true, hee may deny it thee as well as give it thee, and he may alſo as well give it thee as deny it thee; it is as poſſible that thou mayeſt receive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore try all meanes poſſible to obtaine it.

               <p>The 2 concluſion in the text is, that not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this mercy of God is free, yet a man muſt have a will to receive grace and mercy, before he can have it, for ſaith the text, <hi>whoſoever Will let him

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4393:18"/>ſecondly, wherein this will diſcovers it ſelfe, and by that time we ſhall have ſomewhat to hold our ſelves unto. And firſt for the former, what is meant by <hi>will</hi> in this place, we muſt underſtand that this word <hi>will,</hi> it carryeth a double ſignification with it. And firſt it diſcovers that naturall power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty wherewith every man is endued to will, but this is not meant here, <hi>viz.</hi> the very faculty and power wherby a reaſonable man is enabled to will, for then every man ſhould have life and ſalvation, for every man hath this naturall will, for it is with the ſoule, as with a clocke that runneth the wrong way, and ſtriketh falſe, it hath the ſame wheeles like other clocks, but it doth not ſtrike true as other clockes doe, and herein lies the difference, ſo it is with the nature of man fallen from God, the wheele of his will, that is, the power of his underſtanding remaineth ſtill, the nature of the ſoule ſtill exiſteth, but the quality of it is altered, this naturall faculty of the will is not meant here, for then the devils ſhould be ſaved, for they have a naturall will, and therefore in the ſecond place, by will in Scripture, we muſt underſtand the actions and operations, which proceed from the natural faculty of this will which God hath wrought in us, it implyeth any act iſſuing from this faculty upon any object; by object is meant any thing that is preſented to the ſoule, and this diſcovers it ſelfe generally thus, when the face of the ſoule turnes it ſelfe to a thing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth it ſelfe to receive a thing, to cloſe with, and to catch up a thing, as it is with the hand of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4393:18"/>body ſo it is with the will, which is the hand of the ſoule, every man hath hands, but if theſe hands of his be bound together, he is not able to lay hold on any thing, but as a man hath a hand that he may lay hold of a thing, ſo he muſt have his hands at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and he muſt open them, that ſo he may take hold of it, or elſe he cannot lay hold upon it, ſo it is with the hand of the ſoule, this will is the hand of the ſoule, a man muſt therefore turne his will towards a thing and open it ſelfe, the hand of the ſoule muſt be open before it can cloſe with and faſten upon a thing, and this is meant here; when the heart which is turned towards grace, and when the ſoule opens the hand thereof to catch at grace, and lay hold thereupon, then it wils to receive grace, when as wee are unwilling to receive a thing, wee then turne away our hearts from the thing, as children uſe to ſpeake, if you preſſe any thing upon them, which they doe not like, but is diſpleaſing unto them, they ſay, they will not have it, they will not, the ſoule ſhuts it ſelfe againſt that thing, it turnes away from that thing, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable is, how this act of the Will? how this opening of the ſoule doth diſcover it ſelfe? how a man ſhall come to know when he wills grace?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that this ſame turning of the Soule to grace, diſcovers it ſelfe in three particular paſſages; the firſt is this: A man is then ſayd to will a thing, when he apprehends the price of a thing, and hath a high eſteeme of a thing, according to the price of the thing, and the excellency which is in the thing; for it is a rule in naturall Philoſophy, and reaſon telleth us thus much, that no man wills a thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he apprehends the thing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he willeth to be good, either good indeed, or elſe ſeemingly good; for no man willeth his own hurt, for if he did nature would deſtroy it ſelfe, every thing therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the preſervation of it ſelfe, and therefore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4393:19"/>whatſoever is ſuggeſted as evill unto the ſoule of man it will not cloſe with that evill, but turneth from this evill, if it apprehend it as an evill, hence it is that a proud heart loveth proud courſes, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous heart covetous courſes, a malicious heart malicious courſes and practiſes, namely becauſe the ſoule apprehends theſe as good though in themſelves they be evill, yet the ſoule takes them to be beſt for it, now as the ſoule muſt apprehend ſome good in a thing before it can will and deſire it, ſo it muſt apprehend the excellency of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can will it truely, this is that which carryeth the will of a man unto a thing, the <hi>will</hi> will never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe entertaine a thing. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. thing wherein the act of the will is ſeene, and wherein it makes knowne it ſelf is this, when the ſoule ſeeth the good which is in a thing, and apprehends the excellency thereof, ſo the ſecond thing wherein this act of the will is diſcovered is this, the ſoule chooſeth that good which before it hath ſeene, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the thing which it hath apprehended, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the nature of the good, and the excellency thereof, the ſoule it chooſeth that good which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath eſteemed, it takes it to it ſelfe, as who ſhould ſay, I wil have this thing not another, &amp; mark when the ſoule chooſeth any good, it maketh ſuch choyſe of it, as may be anſwerable to the nature of the good which it eſteemeth, as things of greater worth, a man chooſeth with greater affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, things of leſſer worth, with leſſer affection, he will chooſe the beſt things in the firſt place, and thoſe of leſſe

               <p>Thirdly, he that truely willeth a thing, doth not onely apprehend the goodneſſe and the price of the thing which he willeth, and chooſeth it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the price and excellency thereof, but in the third place, the heart giveth up it ſelfe unto that thing which it hath choſen. A man chooſeth a wife a right, he will have the woman whom hee hath choſen, take that poſſeſſion of his heart as becommeth a wife in that caſe, otherwiſe if a man ſay, be chooſe ſuch a man to be king over him, and will not give up his obedience unto him, nor ſuffer him to exerciſe authority over him, this man doth not chooſe him as a king, but rather as a ſervant; ſo that to gather up all, a man is then ſayd to will a thing, when he apprehends the goodneſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the thing, when hee chooſeth that thing anſwerable to the goodneſſe and excellency of it. Thirdly, when the heart giveth up it ſelfe to that thing; now to applyth particulars, when is am an ſayd to Will Chriſt, and grace, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4393:20"/>by him, a man muſt will grace, before he can have grace: but how ſhall a man come to know when he wills grace? I anſwere, firſt when the ſoule of a poore Chriſtian ſeeth an excellency in Chriſt, when he holdeth the Lord Ieſus at a high rate, when he hath him in an high eſtimation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the worth of him, when a poore ſoule can put a price upon the Lord Ieſus, anſwerable to the ſufficiency that is in him, and agreeable to the grace and goodneſſe that is in him, then the ſoule doth partly Will the Lord Ieſus, and grace and Salvation by him; when the ſoule is able to ſee a greater good in the Lord Ieſus, and have a greater eſteeme of the grace which is in him, when it can ſet a higher rate upon the goodneſſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from him, than upon any thing elſe in the world whatſoever, when he hath the Lord Ieſus in higher eſtimation than riches, or honour, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; than of riches that may advance him, or of honour that may promote him, when hee eſteemes Chriſt above any thing that the world can afford, or the heart deſire, then he partly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Chriſt and grace, the ſoule will never <hi>will</hi> a thing truely, but when he ſeeth ſome good in the thing, and hath an high eſtimation of it according to the goodneſſe thereof, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.<note place="margin">Col. 3.11.</note> there ſaith the text, <hi>Chriſt is all in all,</hi> when a ſoule can ſay that <hi>Chriſt is all in all,</hi> that it deſires nothing elſe, then this is the value of him; many will be content to have Chriſt, but they doe not court him worth a great price, but they that will truely <hi>will</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4393:21"/>muſt know and apprehend the excellency that is in Chriſt, and eſteeme him anſwerably thereunto, as you may ſee in the third chap. of the <hi>Lament.</hi> and 24. verſe, there ſaith the text, <hi>The Lord is my portion, therefore will I hope in him,</hi> now a mans portion is his chiefeſt good, and <hi>David</hi> alſo ſaith, thy Commandements have I choſen as mine inheritance, that is, as the chiefeſt good that could befall me, or be received of me: So when the ſoule can truely apprehend that Chriſt is the better part, when the ſoule can ſay it is not neceſſary to bee rich, it is not neceſſary to be learned, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be honourable, nor to have pleaſure or delight, but it is neceſſary to have Chriſt, it is neceſſary to have grace, it is neceſſary to have ſinnes pardoned, when wee can ſay Chriſt is our portion and our inheritance, when we can ſee the excellency that is in him, and can ſet a price upon him anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then we are ſayd to will Chriſt in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing whereby a man may know whether he wills Chriſt or no, is this, when the ſoule ſeeth as the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that all pleaſantneſſe is in Chriſt, when it ſeeth that he is better than friends, better than riches, better than health and liberty, when the ſoule, as it ſetteth an high price upon Chriſt: So in the ſecond place can chooſe Chriſt anſwerable to that price it ſets upon him, when it can chooſe him above all things; let the world goe, that takes Chriſt to it ſelfe,

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4393:22"/>chooſeth Chriſt in the firſt place, anſwerable to the excellency that is in him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the ſoule hath prized Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and choſen him above all, ſo in the third place, if the ſoule truely <hi>will</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, it will be carryed towards Chriſt, to cloſe with him, never to ſever from him againe, for he is ſaid to <hi>wil</hi> a thing that cloſeth with it, and will never part from it, as for example, he that will buy houſe and land, and make it his owne for ever, he firſt choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that houſe and land, and then hee reſolves to keepe it for ever, and never part with it againe, and if hee part from it, or ſell it againe, then he is ſayd to refuſe it, as well as to chooſe it, and the ſtomach that chooſeth meate, when it hath ſuch liking to any dyer, that it openeth it ſelfe and receiveth it, and cloſeth with it; then we are ſayd to will and chooſe Chriſt, when we ſee the worth of Chriſt, and take him before all, and faſten upon him to make him our owne for ever, when wee take ſuch delight in him, that we will not be freed from him, but deſire that he may be for our ſoules, and our ſoules for him forever, this is to <hi>will</hi> the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. So then to gather up all, when the ſoule pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt as the chiefeſt of all, when it chooſeth him above all, when the ſoule anſwerablely giveth up it ſelfe to Chriſt, that Chriſt may take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and never ſever from it, then a man doth <hi>will</hi> Chriſt Ieſus heartily: So that by this time we ſee the nature of the point, and the Engliſh of the Doctrine is thus much, the ſoule that ſeeth the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4393:23"/>worth of Chriſt, and chooſeth him above all things, and cloſeth with him, that ſoule willeth Chriſt Ieſus: But now heere a queſtion may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, you may aske mee whether a man can will Chriſt and grace, thus naturally out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of nature? I anſwere no, it is beyond the power of man, to will Chriſt and grace natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it is the free gift of God; as it is the Lord which muſt give grace, ſo it is the Lord that muſt give the will to receive grace; what availeth all the water in the Sea, if we have no veſſell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it? what avayleth it to have meate, if wee have no ſtomach to digeſt it? what avayleth it to have the fountaine of grace ſet open unto us, if we have no veſſels, no hearts to receive it, if we have no ſtomach to digeſt it? all is worth nothing, &amp; therfore the doctrine of the Scripture is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to raine, the raine which falleth upon a rock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not, but preſently ſlides off; ſo it is here, the fountaine of grace is ſet open to every one that heareth the Word this day, but if you have no veſſels to receive, no wills to embrace it, no heart to entertaine it, all this mercy of God, grace of God, love of God, will fall downe at your feete, you may carry away ſome words in your mouthes, but unleſſe you have a will to receive grace, it will never dwell in your hearts, it is impoſſible that the ſoule ſhould receive grace and Salvation by the Lord Ieſus, unleſſe it hath a will to entertaine him, for common ſence telleth us, that thoſe actions that have relation one to another cannot bee done
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4393:23"/>one without the other; no man can buy, unleſſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſell; no man can take or receive any thing, unleſſe another will give it and beſtow it upon him: Chriſt cannot be beſtowed upon us, and given unto us, unleſſe wee have a will to receive him; there is no giving of a thing, unleſſe there bee a taking and receiving of it: Chriſt will not be a gueſt with us, unleſſe he bee entertained by us. If a man ſhould come unto an Inne and aske for lodging, if the Hoſt of the Inne tell him that the Inne is full, and there is no roome for him, and thereupon hee goes his way, this man cannot be ſayd to be a gueſt unto that Inne, but that hee onely offered himſelfe to bee a gueſt; ſo it is here, there is no ſoule that ever can or ſhall receive Chriſt as a gueſt to himſelfe, unleſſe he be content to make roome for Chriſt, and bee a receiver of him, Chriſt will never come with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or comfort unto thy heart, unleſſe thou haſt a will to entertaine him: if our willing of Chriſt bee that which makes roome for Chriſt, then it muſt go before the entertaining of Chriſt; but the willing of Chriſt is that which makes roome for Chriſt, and therefore it muſt goe before the entertaining of him. So then the caſe is cleare, and the point evident, that a man muſt will to receive Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſhall have Chriſt and grace and ſalvation by him.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the point is threefold, the firſt is for reproofe, muſt a man have a will to receive Chriſt and grace, before hee can receive Chriſt and grace, then this condemneth that carnall conceit of a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4393:24"/>company of poore deluded perſons in the world that thinke they may receive grace upon other conditions than the word hath revealed, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conditions than Chriſt ever made agreement with them; this conceit it is mervailous common, it is a generall fault in all carnall profeſſors, they thinke to goe to heaven, nay, they make no doubt of it, they thinke they have grace, and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay ſo, and profeſſe ſo, and therefore it muſt needs be ſo; becauſe a man can ſay hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, and would have grace, and wils to receive Chriſt, therefore out of all queſtion it muſt needes be ſo, grace muſt needes be given them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without grace, becauſe they ſay they have it; and if a man preſſe upon them, and ſay, the truth is, the world knowes it, that you live in baſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a common ſwearer you are, a covetous wretch, a baſe uſurer, that loves your money more than God; true ſay they, all fleſh is graſſe, and in many things we ſinne, the Lord give us of his grace, and for give us our ſinnes, and I hope he will doe ſo, and this will make up the breach preſently, nothing but repent, and ſay Lord have mercy upon us, and then all will be well, it is true, if you can but truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, all will be well indeede, your ſinnes ſhall bee forgiven you; but now you talke of coſt, you muſt do more than ſay ſo, you muſt do ſo likewiſe; but thus a thouſand poore ſoules goe to hell hood-winckt after this faſhion, they have invented a ſhorter cut to heaven, they have invented a new way, a backe doore to heaven and happineſſe more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4393:24"/>than the word ever diſcovered. But let any ſoule make this conceit good in Scripture, and then I will beleeve them, but if it be ſo that they cannot make it good by the word of God; then know that if you continue in it, your ſoules will be damned. Is it thus in the word, hee that ſaith hee hath grace hath grace, if a man profeſſe grace he cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, no, no, it is not thus in Scripture, the text ſaith, <hi>He that wils grace,</hi> that is hee that hath a heart to receive grace, he ſhall have grace, not hee that ſaith and profeſſeth that he hath grace, but hee that wils it: you muſt not bring your tongues to talke of grace, and your heads to thinke of grace, but you muſt bring your hearts to will grace, otherwiſe you never ſhall, you never can receive grace; and yet notwithſtanding, what is that which carryeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way men in the world; they are naught and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, reprove them for it, they heale all, and make up all preſently, they beleeve in Chriſt, and they repent them of their ſinnes, and ſhall not they bee ſaved? They ſay indeede that they doe beleeve, and they doe repent, but the text ſaith, they doe not ſo, and the Lord in his word ſaith, it is not talke, it is not wiſhes, but it is the willing of Chriſt and grace that will obtaine grace. In the 15 of <hi>Mathew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 15.8, 9.</note> and the 8, and 9, <hi>verſes,</hi> there ſaith the text, <hi>In vaine doe theſe men worſhippe mee, for they draw nigh unto mee with their mouth, and honour mee with their lippes, but their heart is farre from me,</hi> they draw neere Chriſt with their lippes, that is, they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4393:25"/>ſpeake as good words as can bee, they ſay they are ſinners, and that the Lord came to ſave ſinners, and they are humbled for their ſinnes, and attend their Church diligently, and hurt no body, <hi>But their hearts are from me,</hi> ſaith the text, why, <hi>becauſe that hearts are ſtill upon their ſinnes;</hi> they are as proud as ever, as ignorant as ever, as vaine as ever, their hearts ſtill runne after ſinfull courſes, and wicked practiſes, and therefore away with this talke, and ſuch vaine pretences as men make in this caſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe your hearts goe together with your words, all is worth nothing: what a fond imagination is this, that a man ſhould thinke his words ſhould doe him good, when his heart goeth againſt them; when their mouthes profeſſe Chriſt, and their hearts op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt: Thou ſayeſt thou prizeſt Chriſt above all things, and yet thou wilt not loſe a baſe ſinne for Chriſt, thou wilt not forſake any wicked luſt or corruption for Chriſt; you will ſay you prize Chriſt above all, and yet many of your prophane drunkards will not loſe a cup for Chriſt; nay, you will not loſe any baſe cuſtome for Chriſt, you were prophane and you will be ſo ſtill, you were proud and you will bee ſo ſtill; thy heart and thy words doe not goe together, and therefore never thinke that thy words will ſave thee: Thou ſayeſt thou beleeveſt, but thy heart ſaith the contrary: thou profeſſeſt thou haſt grace, but thy heart deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; and therefore it is a very ſottiſh conceit to thinke thy words will doe thee any good, when thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> denieth what thy tongue profeſſeth: goe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4393:25"/>home therefore and examine your owne hearts, and thinke thus with your ſelves; I have talked much, and I have ſaid that I had faith and grace, but oh wretch that I am! my heart ſaith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What a wretch am I, doe I thinke that God will have mercy on mee, becauſe I ſay and profeſſe that I am a ſinner, and becauſe I ſay that I pray unto God for the forgiveneſſe of my ſinnes; no, no, thoſe very words will condemne me, becauſe my heart goes not with my words, it had beene farre better for theſe men that they never had ſpoke theſe things, for theſe very words will riſe up in judgement againſt them, nay theſe words will keep them from the true willing of grace, for they thinke they have it already, becauſe they ſay they have it, this is a very dangerous conceit, and therefore know that words will not carry all away, to ſay we repent and beleeve and have grace, theſe doe us no good at all, wee muſt will grace before wee ſhall have grace, but this is not a willing but onely a tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is a word of terror, to ſhake the hearts of all wretched ſinfull creatures under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thoſe whom wee may condemne out of their owne mouthes, they profeſſe they will not have grace, and therefore wee may conclude they never ſhall have grace, their owne words will witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; for when the Miniſters <hi>liſt up their voyces like a Trumpet,</hi> and cry night and day, and cal upon them, <hi>this is the good and ancient way walke in this way,</hi> in the way of faith and repentance; what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4393:26"/>anſwer doe men give, they openly profeſſe they will not doe this, they will not walke in this way: The Lord tendereth grace, happineſſe, and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto us, and yet many do profeſſe they will not come, they will not attend upon God in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they will not embrace, nor they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine Chriſt and grace and ſalvation, they will not come to the meanes of grace and therefore they ſhall never have grace, they never ſhall bee made partakers of it. A man muſt <hi>will grace,</hi> before he can have grace, but you will it not, you deſire it not, and therefore as ſure as the Lord liveth, you cannot have it.</p>
               <p>Another generation there is, that come to the houſe of God, and ſit as Gods people do, and heare as Gods people doe, <hi>but their hearts runneth after their covetouſneſſe;</hi> when in your ſoules you can ſay, our bodies are here indeed, but our hearts are after our luſts and corruptions, after our profits and pleaſures; if it be thus with you, then ſtill you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that your hearts ſhall not will the grace of God, and therefore it is cleare and evident, that you have not yet received grace.

And did theſe ſpirits thinke yee dye in thoſe times, are not

But you will ſay, you would leave your wicked courſes, and reforme your families if you could doe it, but you cannot. I anſwer, is it nor in your power to plucke your children and your ſervants into the Lords houſe on the Sabbath day, is it not in your power to uſe the meanes whereby you may reforme your lives? you can doe it, but you will not doe it, you will take up your owne wayes, and your owne practiſes, and therefore the caſe is plaine, you will not take Chriſt, and therefore you ſhall never have him, and Salvation by him, there is alſo a curſed kinde of Hypocrites which profeſſe ſaire, and much, they ſay they will doe for the Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">Ier. 24.20.</note> but they are like unto thoſe in the 42. of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> the 20. <hi>verſe,</hi> marke what the

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4393:33"/>whereby our ſoules are inabled to cloſe with the graces and goodneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon is this, becauſe the want of this ſame willingneſſe and heart to receive and embrace Chriſt and grace, is that which breaketh the match betweene God and the ſoule; it is a point of ſome weighty conſideration, there is no lacke on Gods part, there is no failings on Gods ſide which may hinder or debarre a poore ſoule from receiving the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; the fault is our owne and lyeth at home, for God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all to believe in Chriſt, nay he beſeecheth and intreateth them that they would receive the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and comfort and ſalvation by him; nay it cannot be, becauſe God is juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he muſt will that the ſoule ſhould receive the Lord Ieſus and beleeve in him, and bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give entertainement to him in this caſe: So that it is evident that there is no backwardneſſe on Gods part, God doth freely will that every ſoule that heareth the Word of God and hath Chriſt offered, that they ſhould receive the Lord Ieſus and benefit thereby, and comfort there from to their ſoules; but the failing is onely in our part, wee have not a will to receive Chriſt Ieſus when hee is offered, and give entertainement to him, and this is that which breedeth the jarre betweene God and our ſoules, it is not want of obedience to the Commandements of God that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, if the ſoule be but contented to receive Chriſt and entertaine the worke of grace, but

I tell you, wee ſpeake wiſedome which the world and the princes thereof, thoſe that have the greateſt parts never knew, never obtained; you <hi>Corinthian</hi> Doctors bragge much of your learning and knowledge, but you have received it of other humane authors, but wee teach unto you the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and of the Goſpell, which eye hath not ſeene nor eare heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, for God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit, where wee may obſerve by the way, that hee which teacheth the Goſpell in the plaineneſſe of it, teacheth the deepeſt things that can be conceived; for here S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of things which the wiſe of the world never heard of, never conceived. But then they might reply further, how can you know theſe things, and why may not others know them as well as you? Theſe are the two objections that might bee made againſt that which the Apoſtle had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of. How came you to know them, and why may not others know them as well as you? The Apoſtle anſwereth theſe two queſtions. And he anſweres the firſt, how he came to know them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4393:46"/>from the 10. Verſe to the 14. <hi>God</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all things, yea the deepe things of God;</hi> now wee have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that wee might know the things that are freely given to us of God, as if he had ſayd, The ſpirit of God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe things, and teacheth a poore ſoule theſe things as farre as is convenient for him; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God underſtandeth theſe things, and makes knowne theſe things to his ſervants; they know not theſe things of themſelves but by the power of God; Spirit, the Spirit of God aſſiſting and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king effectually in them, teacheth them theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. But then why doe not wicked men come to underſtand theſe great matters alſo? To this the Apoſtle anſwers in the Text, <hi>The naturall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit; for they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe unto him, &amp;c.</hi> they doe not know them becauſe they cannot. A naturall man doth not know theſe things, they are wonders and miracles unto him, tell him how a poore ſoule comes to be humbled and broken, and have his ſinnes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and bee received to mercy, why theſe things are wonders to a carnall man, the Text ſaith, <hi>he doth not underſtand theſe things,</hi> becauſe hee cannot, and the ground of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not the ſpirit to teach them; &amp; this I take to be the ſcope of the Apoſtle in the Text; and in the verſe we are to obſerve onely one point meete for our purpoſe, for as we have ſayd before,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4393:46"/>there are five generall circumſtances of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obſervable; three we have handled, and the fourth is this, No man of himſelfe by nature can will to receive Chriſt; and this is here plainely ſet open in the text, and therein manifeſtly expreſſed, it is the maine ſcope of the holy Ghoſt in the words, a naturall man receiveth not, nay he cannot receive the things of God; but before wee can come to gather the point, two things muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto us. Firſt what is meant by a naturall man. Secondly what is meant by the things of the ſpirit of God. Firſt, what is meant by a naturall man, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might have replyed upon the Apoſtle, what are you a man of the ſpirit onely, what meane you by a naturall man? I anſwere, he is a naturall man, in phraſe of Scripture, which hath not the worke of grace ſoundly wrought in him, which hath not the ſpirit of God; whoſoever he be that lyeth in the boſome of the Church, whoſoever he be that hath a name to live and yet is dead, all carnall Goſpellers and hyppocrites, thoſe that are coloured over with the name of Chriſtians and religion, whoſoever they be that have not that ſaving worke of grace, and the new frame of grace ſet up and reared in their ſoules, by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, all theſe how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may be coloured over, if they have not had the ſanctifying worke of Gods Spirit upon them, all theſe are ſayd according to the Phraſe of the Apoſtle, to be naturall men, and voyd of the ſpirit, as may appeare by the words going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4393:47"/>the Text, and following after. Firſt compare them with the words going before in the 10. and 12. Verſes, <hi>Wee have received the Spirit of God,</hi> faith the Text; the naturall man and the ſpirituall are oppoſed one to another.

               <p>The ſecond thing which is to bee diſcovered is this, <hi>vid.</hi> what is meant by the things of the Spirit of God, and then the point will fall faire and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable.

                  <hi>The inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of him</hi> (meaning God) <hi>from the creation of the world are cleerely ſeene, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and Godhead;</hi> that is, a man that looketh into the frame and fabricke of the world, and ſeeth the making of the earth, and the Sea, and all things therein, hee cannot ſay, but God hath beene here, an infinite wiſdome, and an Almighty power hath beene here, and framed all theſe things, but theſe are not the things of God, which are meant in the text, but there are other things of God which we muſt looke after, and they cannot be diſcerned by the creation of the world, and therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> we ſhall obſerve this, <hi>After that in the Wiſedome of God,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>the world by wiſedome knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching, to ſave them that beleeve,</hi> marke the naturall men might have knowne though they would not, that there was a God, by the wiſedome of God, that is by the wiſedome of God in creating of the World and by the obſervation of things in the ſame, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4393:48"/>they could not take notice of him as a God recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, as a God that ſhould appoint Chriſt as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and as a God that ſhould ſend Chriſt to bee a redeemer, theſe are the things which men could not know by the creation of the world and by the wiſedome thereof; the things of grace and of our redemption, the favour and love that God beares towards his in Chriſt, theſe are the things of God, the things of election, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, juſtification and glorification; theſe are the things of God which are meant eſpecially in the Text, as if he had ſayd, God by the ſpirit can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveale theſe things, theſe come immediatly from God by the meanes hee hath appointed; a man may know that God hath created heaven and earth, and that he hath made all, and provided for all, and yet goe to hell. But hee that hath found Gods love in Chriſt, God working graciouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoule, God humbling his heart and pulling downe his ſoule that hee might bee fit to receive mercy, and then beſtowing mercy upon him; when a ſoule ſeeth theſe things, then theſe are the things of God here meant; Gods ſpirit muſt onely work theſe, the ſpirit onely muſt reveale theſe, and by the operation of the ſpirit wee are made partakers of theſe, theſe are the things of God which are to be underſtood in the Text; God is ſaid to call and to ſanctifie, it is the Spirit that converts, and adopts, and humbles mens ſoules, as who ſhould ſay, Theſe are the workes of the Spirit, there is no ſeeing, there is no perceiving of theſe, there is no way to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4393:48"/>be made partakers of theſe without the ſpirit, ſo that the doctrine now lieth open, and that is this; No man naturally is able of his owne power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpirituall things of grace and ſalvation, no naturall man, that is, he that hath not the ſpirit of God working in him, no man that is in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtate can receive the ſpirituall things of grace and ſalvation. Hee doth not receive them, nay he cannot receive them ſaith the Text, to put out all doubts, and to caſt away all cavills; the Text doth not onely ſay he doth not receive them, but that he cannot receive them, doe hee what he will, doe he what he can, come to a naturall man; and aske him will you receive Chriſt and the worke of grace? why yes with all his heart, and he makes no doubt but he doth ſo, and hee hopes hee ſhall finde the comfort of it. The Text ſaith, God ſaith, the truth ſaith, you doe not, nay you cannot, you ſay you doe, whom ſhall wee beleeve in this caſe, God or you; I can prove you are a naturall man, you live in baſe wicked courſes, the Spirit of God is an holy Spirit; you live in ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unlawfull courſes, the Spirit of God is a wiſe Spirit, you are ignorant and know not the things belonging to ſalvation, and therefore the world knowes, and you know that you are a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, and the ſpirit, that ſaith a naturall man cannot receive the things of God, and yet you ſay you can, whom therefore ſhall we beleeve? ſo that the point is plaine, that a man by nature hath not power to will to receive Chriſt and grace and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4393:49"/>ſalvation by him, and we will make good the point in foure particulars, by way of explication, That a man hath not power to will to receive grace and ſalvation by Chriſt; Firſt to omit that which the Papiſts themſelves confeſſe in this caſe, namely that a naturall man of himſelfe cannot finde out the meanes of life and Salvation, but God muſt give him ſome preventing grace, he muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, that is, God muſt reveale and make knowne the things that concerne his peace unto him out of the Word; hee muſt diſcover thoſe things unto him, which appertaine to his peace and juſtification by Chriſt.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4393:53"/>of heart againſt the word when it is preached, ſometimes a mans conſcience is opened and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Word of God, and what followes? why preſently hee profeſſeth hee will never heare that Miniſter more, hee ſaith tis pittie hee ſhould ever preach more, and tw'ere good hee were out of the Country, and that the kingdome were rid of him; alas, what doth the Miniſter this while, what doth he intend all this while that you take ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte at him, why, you have a proud heart, hee would humble it, he would plucke you out of your corruptions that you may be prepared for grace, but your ſoules ſay, you will not be wrought upon and framed, that you may receive grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; however you doe not profeſſe ſo much with your mouthes, yet your actions teſtifie as much, there is never a faithfull Miniſter of God but ſpeakes home to the conſciences of men, and tells them of their beloved ſinnes and boſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hee doth this to prepare way for the Lord Ieſus. He knowes you muſt be fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace and ſalvation, before you ſhall be made partakers of grace and ſalvation; he knowes that there are many mountaines to bee levelled, and crooked things to bee made ſtraight, and many rough things to bee made ſmooth and plaine, and therefore hee intends nothing but to have your ſoules broken and prepared for Chriſt, but you ſay you will not bee humbled and framed, and made fit to ſee the things that belong to your peace here, and your ſalvation hereafter, and therefore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4393:54"/>you cannot receive the things of God: ſo then to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up all together, if it be ſo, that when the things of grace and ſalvation are revealed and offered, a naturall man doth turne away from them, if it bee ſo that though the Lord ſtriveth with a naturall man, and labours by his Spirit to winne him and wooe him to receive grace, yet he reſiſts the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and takes up armes againſt the offer of grace; if it bee ſo that when the Lord followes him with grace, yet a naturall man is not capable of grace, if it bee ſo that the heart of a naturall man is not ſubject to the Word of God, and would not bee wrought upon that he may be made fit to receive grace, then it is cleare, that a naturall man cannot receive the things of God if hee goes away from grace offered and reſiſts grace preſſed; if hee be not capable of grace, and is unwilling to be made capable, then the point is evident, and the doctrine undeniable, namely that a man in his naturall eſtate cannot receive the things of grace and ſalvation; and this is a thing ſo cleare to a gracious heart, as nothing more; wee ſee then the proofe of the point, a naturall man cannot receive the things of God, the reaſons of the point why a naturall man cannot but doe thus, as he doth withdraw himſelfe from grace offered, and reſiſt and oppoſe the Word of God. The grounds of it are three, the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument alledged is taken out of the words of the Text, and it ſtands thus, a naturall man cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things of God, why? becauſe they are ſpiritully diſcerned, what is that? the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4393:54"/>is this, hee that will receive ſpirituall things, muſt have ſome ſpirituall ability and power about him, ſome ſpirituall helpe vouchſafed unto him for the performance of this work; a man that will diſcern ſpirituall things muſt have a power anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that hee would diſcerne, a man muſt have ſpirituall helpe from heaven before hee can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirituall graces; for ſpirituall graces and the ſpirituall worke of the Lord are onely agreeable and fitting one for another, but now no naturall man hath any ſpirituall power, theſe two things are differ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt in their kindes, namely nature and the Spirit, a naturall man hath nothing of the Spirit, no ſpirituall ability in him, but hee muſt have a ſpirituall ability that can diſcerne the things of the Spirit, and therefore a naturall man cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne ſpirituall things; thus I reaſon, no naturall faculty can put forth a ſupernaturall worke, a thing that is barely within the compaſſe of nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put forth an action above the nature of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every thing workes within its compaſſe; as the tree that growes, it cannot goe and walke as the beaſt doth; the beaſt that hath the ſenſuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, that walkes, and ſees, and heares and feeles, but it cannot reaſon; man hee hath the reaſonable facultie, and he reaſons and performes ſuch actions as belong to him; now every one of theſe worke within their owne compaſſe, they have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kinds of operations; the tree growes, the beaſt feeles, and man reaſons, and none of theſe can exceede their owne nature, or put forth a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4393:55"/>worke above their nature, ſo that then wee ſee no naturall power can performe a ſupernaturall worke, but a naturall man as hee came into the world hath nothing but nature in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot diſcerne the things of God, which is a ſupernaturall worke wrought by the Spirit of God, for ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>they are ſpiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is this, all naturall men are altogether fleſhly, that is, wholly overpowred with ſinne; marke that place in the third of <hi>Iohn</hi> and ſixt, there ſaith the Text, <hi>whatſoever is borne of the fleſh is fleſh,<note place="margin">Ioſtn 3.6.</note> and that which is borne of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſpirit,</hi> but now marke all the things of God, as firſt election, ſecondly converſion, thirdly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, fourthly juſtification, fiftly glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the like, they are nothing elſe but ſpirituall, they are ſpirituall things, the grace of God is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and the Word of God is ſpirituall; now marke what followeth in the fift of <hi>Galathians</hi> the 17.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> there ſaith the Text, <hi>The fleſh luſteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, &amp; theſe now are contrary the one to the other,</hi> that is, a naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart reſiſts and is contrary to the worke of Gods Spirit, they luſt one againſt another, and are contrary one to another; then marke how I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the former ground, if the ſoule of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man be profeſſely oppoſite and contrary to the Spirit of grace, then the ſoule of a naturall man will not of it ſelfe, nay it cannot receive and entertaine Chriſt and grace, they that oppoſe and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4393:55"/>would deſtroy one another, they will not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one another; as for example, fire and water are contrary one to another, and therefore they will not meete together and entertaine one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but continually ſeeke to deſtroy one another, ſo light and darkeneſſe they are contrary, and therefore will not receive one another but ſeeke the deſtruction one of another, as when light comes darkeneſſe is gone, and when darkeneſſe comes light that muſt be gone; but now marke, the heart of a naturall man is all fleſh, and the things of God are all Spirit, and therefore theſe two are contrary, and therefore oppoſe and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another; the heart of a naturall man is contrary to God and grace, and therefore cannot receive and entertaine God and grace, but ſeeke to deſtroy them, and therefore it is obſerveable in the 8. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the wiſedome of the fleſh is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Spirit of God, it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeede can be;</hi> when the heart of a naturall man begins to feele the blow by the hand of Gods Spirit ſtirring and ſtriving in him to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him and make him fit for grace, it flyeth backe preſently, and will by no meanes be are the blow of the Spirit, it will not give way to the worke of God. Now marke how I diſpute, that which will not, nay that which cannot be ſubject to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that will never receive grace which is the worke of the Spirit of God, but a naturall man whatſoever he hath, even his wiſedome is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Spirit, hee will not beare, hee will not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4393:56"/>away with the worke of the miniſtery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee cannot receive grace, and this is the ſecond paſſage. If the nature of a naturall man be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fleſh, and is contrary to grace, and will not be ſubject to the Spirit, then it cannot receive grace; but all naturall men are contrary to grace, they are altogether fleſh and reſiſt the ſpirit and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot entertaine grace.</p>
               <p>The third Argument is this, a dead man hath no power to procure life unto himſelfe, but all men by nature are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, and therefore no naturall man is able to procure ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life unto himſelfe; for the underſtanding of this argument, know thus much, that the nature of man ſince his fall is ſtripped of all that holineſſe and righteouſneſſe whereby he might bee enabled to the performance of any ſpirituall worke, and not onely ſo, hee is not onely deprived of the image of God, but is altogether overſpread with wickedneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe, which take the poſſeſſion of every poore ſoule under heaven, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Iohn 3.6.</note> now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man naturally is altogether fleſh, the will of man and the heart of man is altogether fleſhy; and therefore in the heart of man there is no good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all. And conſider the reaſon of this, why the whole ſoule is thus defiled with ſinne, wee muſt conceive that <hi>Adam</hi> was not onely a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he took the whole nature of mankind upon him; ſo that the nature of man in <hi>Adam</hi> while he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was in his innocencie might either bee carried to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4393:56"/>the obedience of the will of God, or elſe wholly againſt the will of God, and therefore by <hi>Adams</hi> fall man was altogether deprived of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and caried againſt the will of God. Now to preſſe the Argument if it be ſo that all mens hearts are poſſeſſed with rebellions by nature, and turned away from God; then men naturally cannot turne unto God, but all men naturally are wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with ſinne, and by rebellion, are turned from God, and therefore they cannot naturally turne unto God. Againe conſider there muſt bee ſome ſpirituall power, ſome ſpirituall life put into a man before hee can performe any good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a naturall man cannot doe any good, but is a dead man in reſpect of grace, becauſe be hath loſt that ſame ſoule of righteouſnes whereby he ſhould performe that good which God requireth, and ſo that holineſſe being gone, the ſoule of the will is gone, and the power to doe any good or receive any good is gone. So then the caſe is cleare and the point evident by force of argument and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that a naturall man hath no power to receive the Lord Ieſus, and grace, and ſalvation from him.</p>
               <p>If this be true as hath beene prooved by reaſon plaine and undeniable arguments, that a naturall man cannot receive the things of God, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoule may take notice of and condemne that ſottiſh and fooliſh conceit that harbours in the minde of many ſilly poore ignorant ſoules; if any of you know ſuch, take notice of them; there are

But before I can come to lay
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4393:67"/>downe the point of Doctrine, two paſſages muſt be opened: firſt, what is meant by heart, ſecondly, what is meant by a ſtony heart, and what by a fleſhy heart; and theſe two being opened, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will be plaine and lie faire: firſt for the firſt: a heart in Scripture, beſides that which it ſignifieth naturally; is applied to the will of a man, or to that ability which is in a reaſonable ſoule, whereby he willeth or rejecteth a thing, this is put for a heart in Scripture, together with love, delight, joy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and griefe, which are attendants upon this will; as a man will have ſuch a thing, why? becauſe beloves it, and delightes in it; and hee againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth ſuch a thing and will not have it, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hates it, and becauſe it is diſpleaſing unto him; and this is the meaning of that place, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 15.19.</note> 15.19. <hi>Out of the heart proceede evill thoughts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, adulteries fornications, thefts, falſe witneſſe, blaſphemie.</hi> Secondly, the Will is put in phraſe of Scripture, not onely for ability of the ſoule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it wills, but for the ſame ſpirituall diſpoſition, that is, in the will &amp; affections of a man, in this kind the temper and frameableneſſe of the Will to any action is termed by the name of heart in Scripture; for there is ſomewhat in the Will, whereby it is carried to any worke: looke as it is with a Bowle it runneth, becauſe it is a round thing, but that it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at ſuch and ſuch a marke, is becauſe it hath a Bias upon it, whereby it is ſwayed and carried to that marke; ſo it is with the heart of a man, there is not onely an abilitie therein, whereby a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4393:68"/>to will, but there is a frame and a diſpoſition in the Will, either to good or evill, either to grace or ſinne, and as the will of a man is biaſſed and ſwayed, ſo a man is ſaid to will good or evill, not in regard of the naturall faculty of the Will, but in regard of the diſpoſition of that facultie which doth carrie the faculty to the performance of any worke: now a righteous man out of the diſpoſition of his heart, is carried to yeeld obedience unto Gods commandements; and a wicked man out of the frame and temper of his heart is carried after luſts and diſtempers and ſinnefull abominations; and this is the meaning of that place,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>The Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive to this day,</hi> why? they had a heart, for they were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, they had the naturall faculty of the Will and the underſtanding and affections, but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, they had not the gracious diſpoſition in their wils, whereby they might be carried and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to will that which was pleaſing to God, and might be comfortable unto themſelves: it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie phraſe,<note place="margin">Match. 12.35.</note>

               <p>The ſecond paſſage to be opened is this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is meant by a ſtony, what by a fleſhie heart; Firſt what is meant by a ſtony heart; a heart is ſaid to be ſtonie by way of reſemblance, becauſe it is of the nature of a ſtone, looke what the nature of a ſtone is, ſuch is the nature of a heart compared thereunto, a ſtony heart, that is, an unſenſible and an uncapable heart; a ſtone that is inſenſible, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth no impreſſion, ſet a ſeale upon a ſtone and preſſe it downe never ſo hard, &amp; you may break the ſtone in peeces, but it will receive no impreſſion, it wil take no print; but now ſet a ſeale upon waxe, and that will receive any impreſſion that a man ſtampes upon it, ſo it is with a ſtony, ſtout, ſturdy heart, though God knocke it in peeces it will not be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, it will receive no impreſſion, but reſiſts and

               <p>Secondly, what is meant by a heart of fleſh, and that is quite contrary to a ſtony heart, it is like unto fleſh, ſoft, tender, eaſie, and pliable, willing to take any impreſſion that comes upon it; ſo that now a fleſhie heart is nothing elſe but a heart lovingly teachable, and humbly tractable to the Lord, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to entertaine any impreſſion that it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to ſtampe upon it; if God commands any thing, that obeyeth, it God threatens, that trembles; it is ſaid of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why ſaith he, I will take away that ſtony ſturdy heart which is in them, and will give them a frameable heart and a teachable heart, which ſhall yeeld to whatſoever I cammand, and then they will be able to caſt away all thoſe evills which they have embraced, and performe all thoſe holy duties which they have neglected, the heart which God takes away from them cannot be meant the heart it ſelfe, the naturall facultie of willing, and the heart which hee gives them, cannot be meant the bare faculty it ſelfe, but the rebellious diſpoſition that was in the faculty the Lord removeth, and that ſame teachable, frameable diſpoſition he putteth into the facultie, whereby their hearts ſhould be carried to that which was pleaſing to God, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to themſelves. I intend to ſpeake of two things concerning Gods taking away of this ſame ſtony heart, and giving a heart of fleſh unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: firſt, that God doth this, that hee is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it; ſecondly, I will ſpeake of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time when God doth this, when he thus workes upon the hearts of his choſen, ſometimes ſooner ſometimes later; and this, ſame circumſtance of time when the Lord doth this is double; firſt in regard of the meanes, the Lord doth thus worke upon the hearts of thoſe which belong to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, when hee gives them the meanes of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4393:70"/>ſalvation when they have the Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpell ſhining in their faces: The ſecond circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this time, is in regard of the men whom the Lord will thus worke upon, ſome ſooner, ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome in all ages; ſome in their young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derage, ſome in their middle age, and ſome, though very few, in their old age: Firſt I will ſpeake of the Authour of this, and that is God, hee takes away the ſtony heart, and gives a heart of fleſh to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Doctrine out of the words is, The taking away of the indiſpoſition of the ſoule to any good dutie, and the fitting, framing, and diſpoſing of a ſoule to performe any ſpirituall ſervice, is the alone worke of God, hee removes the indiſpoſition of the ſoule, and hee puts the diſpoſition to any good into the ſoules of his; the caſe is cleare, if we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after this manner what is a ſtony heart? A ſtony heart is a ſturdy, unteachable heart, uncapeable and indiſpoſed to any good; what is a heart of fleſh? it is a lowly, teachable, pliable heart, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive any impreſſion that God ſtampes upon it, who takes away the one? The Lord; who gives the other? The Lord. So that both the remooving of the ſtony heart is the Lords worke, and the giving of the fleſhy heart is the Lords worke alſo, <hi>I will take away their ſtony heart, and I will give them a heart of fleſh.</hi> Nay the Lord doth make it his chiefeſt prerogative to doe this worke for a poore ſinner;<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.25.</note>

The power of Gods ſtrength, the depth of Gods wiſedome, and the riches of Gods mercy is diſcovered in this worke of converſion; here is power againſt all power, and ſtrength above all ſtrength; for the Lord doth not meete with the ſoule of a ſinner in the worke of converſion, as hee did in the worke of creation with the world, for when he made the world, hee met with nothing to reſiſt him, but he onely ſpoke the word, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and it was made; but when the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to meete with the ſoule of a poore ſinner, to open his eyes and convert him unto himſelfe, and bring him home; hee meeteth with the whole

               <p>The grounds of the point why it is neceſſary that God ſhould be the Author both of taking away the ſtony heart and giving the heart of fleſh are theſe, if we doe but conſider the nature of the ſtonineſſe and the fleſhineſſe of the heart, it will appeare that God onely can take away the one and give the other. Firſt if we conſider the nature of the ſtony heart, and the diſtempers thereof, it will appeare that it muſt bee the worke of the Lord onely to take it away; and not to follow any other ſimilituds then the Text affords; I will ſhew the ſimilitude and reſemblance that is betweene the ſturdy ſtout heart of a ſinner and a ſtone, by which it ſhall bee made manifeſt, that none but the Almighty power of God is able to remoove it. Now in a ſtone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve three particulars, which diſcover the nature of it; firſt the ground of all, the hardneſſe which is in the ſtone is from hence, there is a cloſe faſtning, combining, and knitting of the parts together which is the ground of the hardneſſe that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; as for example, take a path, if it be continually plowed up, it will bee ſoft and looſe, but if many walke upon it, if it be continually trod upon then it will be hard; what is the reaſon of this, namely this hardneſſe proceeds from the cloſe faſtning and ſetling of the earth together, this it is which makes the way hard, but if it were daily plowed, and the earth continually looſened, it would then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>e hard.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:4393:72"/>
               <p>Secondly, from this faſtning of the parts of a ſtone together, as there comes hardneſſe, ſo alſo from this hardneſſe ariſeth a great ſtrength in the ſtone, and that is the reaſon that the hardeſt things are marvelous ſtrong; a child before his joynts be ſetled is but weake, he is not come to his ſtrength, but a man when his parts are ſetled, and his joynts throughly knit together, then wee uſe to ſay, bee is come to his full ſtrength; and ſo it is in mettals, thoſe mettals that are cloſeſt knit together and moſt nearely concocted, they are ſayd to bee ſtrongeſt mettalls, as Gold is ſayd to be a ſtronger mettall then Silver, and Silver is ſayd to bee a ſtronger mettall then Lead, becauſe the parts thereof are more nearely ſetled and more cloſely concocted: So it is the nature of ſtones, thoſe ſtones whoſe parts are moſt combined together as Flints, they are ſayd to be the hardeſt ſtones, and thoſe whoſe parts are not ſo cloſely knit, they are ſayd to be more ſoft and of leſſe ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the hardneſſe and ſtrength of a ſtone, there comes a reſiſtance againſt any thing from without it, becauſe the parts of a ſtone are knit together, therefore it is hard, and from the hardneſſe thereof proceedes ſtrength; and being hard and ſtrong in the third place it reſiſts and bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The firſt Vſe is an uſe of inſtruction; from hence wee may ſee, that therefore this great worke of converſion, the fitting and preparing of a poore ſinner to entertaine the Lord Ieſus, it is a worke of great weight, it is a worke not of ordinary, but of marvellous and admirable difficulty; if it be the worke of the Lord onely, if nothing elſe can doe this worke but it lieth upon Gods alone almightie power, if all meanes faile, nay, if the wiſedome of men &amp; Angells ſtand agaſt &amp; amazed at this work,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:4393:77"/>then I muſt conclude it is the Lords worke, and is ought to be marvellous in our eyes. And from hence it is that it is a marvellous wonder that any creature that is under the power of ſinne and Satan it is a wonder it is a miracle that after all teaching, after all meanes uſed, any ſoule is humbled and prepared to receive mercy from the hand of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: Nay, hence it is that wee ſee little profit come from the worke of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie when wee ſee the greatneſſe of this worke of converſion, wee may wonder how it commeth to paſſe that any are converted and brought home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord; the Miniſters are faine to lift up their voyces like trumpets, and ſpend their hearts as it were, they pray againe, and faſt againe, and preach againe, and yet all will not dee; for when is the heart of any humbled, when is the ſoule of any tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and converted unto God, and therefore away with that curſed deluſion that harbours in the minds of many men, they will repent, and they will beleeve when they liſt, why? Alas it is not in your power, it is the almighty worke of God, thou haſt not the worke of repentance to command at thy pleaſure; it is not talking and ſaying, I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with all my heart, and doe beleeve that will ſerve the turne, this will not doe, the Lord muſt worke effectually in thy ſoule by his almighty power, or elſe the union that is betweene ſinne and thy ſoule will not be diſſolved, or elſe the ſtrength of ſinne and power of Satan that is in thy ſoule will never be vanquiſhed, or elſe the reſiſtance that is in

Theſe three wee have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the 22. of the <hi>Revelations</hi> the 17. The fourth was that a man by nature cannot receive Chriſt and grace, and that wee handled out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The fift was, howſoever a ſoule by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot receive Chriſt and ſalvation, yet God will bring the ſoules of his to prize Chriſt, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of him, and bee willing to entertaine him, and then he will beſtow Chriſt and ſalvation upon them, this wee handled out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4393:81"/>this worke of God in the preparing of a ſoule for himſelfe, there are two further circumſtances to be conſidered in regard of the time when God will doe this, and the firſt circumſtance is in regard of the meanes, the ſecond in regard of the men which are to bee wrought upon; and ſo wee have a trouble conſideration in regard of the time when God will thus prepare the ſoule of a poore ſinner for himſelfe; the firſt is in reſpect of the meanes, and that is this, when the Goſpel of life and ſalvation is ſent and revealed to a people and continued to a people, if ever God worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of men, if ever hee meanes to bring people to the knowledge of the things belonging to their peace, it is then when the Lord is pleaſed to ſend his faithfull Miniſters among them, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the meanes of life and ſalvation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond circumſtance is in regard of the men that God will work upon; ſome ſooner ſome later, ſome in their young and tender age, ſome in their middle age and in their ripe yeares, and ſome though very few in their old age, few are called when they are old, God calls ſome ſuch but very few, as wee ſhall heare hereafter. Wee will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle now the circumſtance of time in regard of the meanes, when God doth purpoſe good into a man, or towne, or a country, or a kingdome, namely when the Lord ſends his Goſpel among them &amp; his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters to diſcover the meanes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4393:84"/>more or leſſe as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had when the meanes of ſalvation were diſcovered unto it. The doctrine with which we will grapple is thus much, namely That while life is continued, &amp; the meanes of grace &amp; ſalvation afforded to a people, that is the ſeaſon wherein God meaneth to worke upon their hearts effectually that they may receive life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

But in the common courſe of God, if ever ſoule now be converted, it muſt be by the miniſtery of the word, that is our day, that is our time, that is the ſpeciall ſeaſon wherein God will vouchſafe to looke upon poore ſinners, and convert them unto himſelfe; if a man were not alive meanes would not profit him, and if a man were alive and had no meanes, hee could get no good neither; but when both theſe goe together, then is the time wherein God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4393:84"/>life and ſalvation, then is the ſeaſon wherein God (if ever) will worke upon the ſoule of a ſinner to make him fit to entertaine things belonging to his peace. We muſt handle two parts in the point, firſt that a mans life is part of this ſeaſon; ſecondly that the meanes offered in that ſeaſon is the making up of the point, wee will prove both parts ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and then make uſes of them both together. Firſt wee will proove that the time of a mans life is part of the ſeaſon wherein God will worke effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon him for his everlaſting comfort,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.10.</note> in the in the ninth of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 10. there ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to doe, doe it with thy might, for there is no worke, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wiſedome in the grave whither thou goeſt;</hi> as though he had ſayd, if there be any thing that God requireth of thee, If there be any duty that ought to be diſcharged by the labour whilſt thou liveſt to doe it.

It was the word of the rich man when he had filled his barnes full of goods, and his purſe full of money, then he ſaith unto his ſoule, Soule take thy reſt, thou haſt goods layd up for many yeares; take thy cups ſaith the drunkard, take thy whore ſaith the adulterer. Oh foole this night the divell may hale thy ſoule into everlaſting confuſion, how knoweſt thou but that ſentence may bee given upon thee which was given upon him, and then there will be no repentance in the grave. But bee it ſo that thy life may continue which is very uncertaine, though thy day continue, yet the day of grace happily will not continue, that is but a minute of the particular time of thy day, if God take away the light of the Goſpell, thou mayſt die ſo hunger and thirſt, and never come to the like mercies, never receive the like incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou that heretofore haſt deſpiſed a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter, it may bee thou ſhalt never ſee the face of a good Miniſter more hereafter, and then what ſhall become of all thy faire hopes and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Nay conſider that this which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken may be the caſe of any one in this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every man hath his day, I gave her a time to repent ſaith the Lord of wicked <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> but ſhee would not, the Lord would have plucked her out of her bed of downe, and from the armes of her lovers into a bed of ſorrow, ſhee hath now paine for her pleaſure and ſorrow for her jollitie, who knoweth but this may be my day and thy day, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mans day. When the word of God comes home to the ſoule of a man, and the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to knocke at the conſcience of a poore ſinner, he may then breake out into admiration, and ſay, is it thus? is the Lord ſo compaſſionate that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my rebellions hee is ſtill pleaſed to ſtrive with mee, nay to mourne over me, as hee did over <hi>Ieruſalem, O that thou hadst knowne at leaſt in this thy day the things belonging to thy peace,</hi> many mercies hath the Lord let into my ſoule to allute me, many judgements to terrifie me, many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to perſwade me, and hath uſed all meanes poſſible to bring mee to a better life, no mercy equalls this, no goodneſſe is to be compared with this, thus take notice of the mercies of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and go aſide and make good uſe of thoſe good motions that God by his Spirit ſhall ſuggeſt into your ſoules; and if the Lord hath almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

And now what remaineth more, when a man reſolves that this is his day, and that now the Lord comes neare unto him, but even then preſently to breake off all impediments, and leape over all blockes that lie in his way, and reſolve thenceforward to bid adue to all his corruptions; hee ſhould conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and ſay, ſeeing the Lord doth even mourning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrive with me for my good, then I will never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more to thoſe luſts, I will never yeeld more to thoſe occaſions that have gotten the maſtery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, I would wiſh every poore ſoule, to take up this reſolution, to give a bill of divorcement to his ſinnes, and never to ſee the face of his corruptions any more; to doe this now will be a very hard thing, I know it, and experience proves it, your luſts will cleave to you and hang about you, you would be loath to part with your old corruptions, old friends that have beene of old acquaintance, for theſe to be ſhaken off on a ſudden, this will be very grievous:

Why do, you as he did, and ſay, why not to day Lord, why not to day; you could be content on your death beds to be drunke no more, why cannot you as well to day reſolve to be ſober; the adulterer when he lies upon his death bed wil not endure ſo much as to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Quene, why ſhould hee not as well abſtaine from this baſe ſinne to day, wee know not whether the meanes may be taken from us, or wee from the meanes, and therefore when the Lord ſaith, <hi>My face ſeeke you,</hi> anſwer againe and ſay, <hi>thy face Lord will we ſeeke.</hi>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4393:95"/>laugh at your deſtruction, and mocke when your feare commeth; when your feare commeth like ſudden deſolation, and your deſtruction as a whirlewind.</hi> There was a time when the Lord called to all deſpiſers of grace and refuſers of mercie, how long and how often, but they that would not heare, the time will come, when the Lord will ſay, I will laugh at your deſtruction; when a poore ſinnefull creature at the day of judgement ſhall come before the Lord of glory, the devill drawing him, and then the Lord ſhall laugh at him, and ſay, how often have I ſent unto you, and called upon you, and you would not heare nor regard me? Behold men and Angels, this is the man, this is hee that contemned my Word, and ſlighted the meanes of ſalvation, and therefore laugh at him, mocke at his deſtruction: Oh what will become of that man then when the Lord of mercy ſhall not onely take mercy from him, when the God of goodneſſe ſhall not onely take goodneſſe from him, but ſhall laugh at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and ſhall rejoyce when hee executes his judgements upon this man to his everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and therefore I beſeech you take heede of this dangerous conceit.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſhift is this, if all will not work upon the ſoule, then it falls upon this, is it ſo that grace and mercie being neglected they ſhall never be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, why then it takes up this concluſion, if I never have grace and mercy, then I can live without it; oh foole if there were any creature of this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this congregation, I may ſpeake terrible
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4393:96"/>things unto that ſoule, when a man is brought to this paſſe that he cares not what becomes of his ſoule, when hee ſayes what matter is it if I have not grace, is this ſuch a loſſe? When a ſoule is come to this, oh then he is in a miſerable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, in a woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentable eſtate: is it no matter to be ſaved, is it no matter to be comforted, is it no matter to be glorified eternally, what matter is it to loſe grace? Nay what availeth it to live frolickely here and miſerably hereafter? What matter is it to neglect grace here, and to be deprived of glory hereafter, is this no matter? Let me ſay to you, as the man of God did to his ſervant,<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.26.</note> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Is this a time to take money and receive garments and olives, and vineyards and ſheepe and oxen?</hi> So ſay I, is this a time to live frolickely and merrily? Is this a time for a man to follow curſed companions, and embrace ſinnefull corruptions, is this a time for a man to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the world, and the vanities thereof, and in the meane time neglect the meanes of life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No, no, know it is the day of God, the day of grace, our ſoules lie at pawne, if theſe opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be omitted, woe and griefe and paine, and wormewood will be upon that man by whom they be neglected, he that deſpiſeth theſe meanes here ſhall live miſerably hereafter, everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glory depends upon this opportunitie; tell not me it is a day of marchandiſe, and you muſt provide for your families, I tell you it is a day of ſalvation, haſt thou time to provide for thy houſe and familie, and not for thy ſoule and for thy ever
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4393:96"/>laſting happineſſe. So then gather up all briefely and the ſcope will be this, it is now the moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune time, and therefore the fitteſt, it is the day of ſalvation &amp; therefore the ſhorteſt, it is the day of viſitation and therefore the greateſt commoditie, the opportunity is the fitteſt, the day is the ſhorteſt, the commoditie the greateſt, and what remaineth now, but that the Lord will worke this upon your ſoules, that he which ſpake this to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> whilſt he lived on earth, may ſpeake the ſame to you though now in glory, and perſwade your hearts to entertaine this opportunitie to make uſe of this day and embrace this commoditie.</p>
               <p>But if all meanes will not perſwade men hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, then the laſt uſe is an uſe of exhortation unto us all, to pitty the caſe of ſuch men, and to ſhew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for the deſolation of thoſe that neglect the meanes of their ſalvation. If wee cannot perſwade you, yet give us leave to mourne for you, if our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions will not take place in your ſoules, yet I hope you will give us leave to goe in ſecret, and let our eyes droppe downe teares for the miſerable deſolation that will fall upon thoſe that neglect the meanes of life and happineſſe: you muſt not thinke to paſſe thorough Purgatory, you muſt not thinke to goe to heaven whither you will or no; me thinks I ſee a poore creature that ſlighted mercy &amp; ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it was offered unto him; me thinkes I ſee that ſoule lying upon his death bed, light is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his eyes, &amp; his ſoule is departing from his body, his body is a burthen to him in regard of his diſeaſe, and his conſcience a hell unto him in regard
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4393:97"/>of his ſinnes, oh the name of a Miniſter, of a Church, they are all as bills of inditements com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt the ſoule of this man, me thinkes I heare ſuch a man ſay at his laſt gaſpe, the day is gone, the gate is ſhut, and now it is too late to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and thus the ſoule departs from the body, the body to the grave, and the ſoule to hell: Oh what bitter and wofull lamentations will that ſoule make when it comes in hell! Oh the golden time that I have ſeene and not regarded, oh the gracious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſalvation that my eyes have beheld, and yet I neglected! Oh the mercy and grace and goodneſſe of God that have been offered unto me, and I have contemned and trampled under my feet, and therfore now muſt be tormented with the devil &amp; his angels from ever laſting to everlaſting, on the Lord give us hearts to take notice of theſe things. If we cannot doe what good we would to men, yet let us lament their miſerable conditions; wives mourne for your husbands, parents mourne for your children, and ſay the Lord hath offered the meanes of ſalvation both profitable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet my husband heares not, my child receives not theſe meanes, why then mourne and lament oh my poore husband, oh my child, thou mighteſt have had grace, but now it is taken from thee, thou hadſt the offer of ſalvation, and now perhaps it ſhall never again be tendered to thee; but if mercy cannot prevaile with you, nor the voyce of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters take place in you, yet let the ſaftie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your owne ſoules, move you to make
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4393:97"/>much of the opportunities and meanes of grace and ſalvation. Let every maſter of a family goe home and reſolve and ſay, this is my day Lord, this very day may be my day, and thy day, the laſt day that ever I ſhal ſpeak, the laſt day that you ſhall ever heare. If I were now breathing out my laſt breath, I would breath our this legacie to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians which I leave behinde me, This is the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, this is the day of ſalvation: He that hath an eare to heare, let him now heare, he that never had a heart, let him now have a heart to embrace theſe things, whilſt grace and ſalvation is offered unto him, let him entertaine this offer. It doth mee good to conſider if the ſoule of a man would but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy and grace now while it is offered him this day, what comfort he may have for ever, both here and hereafter, he might then ſay, this day I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived comfort, I was never humbled before, but this day I was humbled, I could never before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any mercy, but this day I received it, this was a good day to me. Oh if men would but be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take the opportunity while it laſts, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the meanes of grace and ſalvation while they are offered: Oh what comfort might men gaine hereby, then at the laſt day they ſhould receive an everlaſting crowne of glory, they ſhould then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruits of their labours even the ſalvation of their ſoules. Let us all therefore as wee love our owne ſoules be exhorted, to entertaine the things of grace here, that wee may obtaine the things of glory hereafter.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee have heard heretofore that all men being dead in ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes are ſo farre from working out their owne ſalvation from themſelves, as that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive grace and mercy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them from the Lord, for the comforting of their hearts here, and obtaining of happineſſe hereafter, and therefore the laſt generall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4393:98"/>of preparation we did handle, was this, That howſoever a naturall man is not able to underſtand the things of the Lord, yet the Lord will make all thoſe which belong unto him able to receive the Lord Ieſus, and then he will beſtow the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and grace and ſalvation upon them. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this point, there are two circumſtances of ſpeciall conſideration. The firſt is the circumſtance of time in regard of the meanes, and that wee have already handled out of <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. and the point then delivered was this; When God continues life and the meanes of ſalvation to a people, then this is the time when God meanes to beſtow mercy and ſalvation upon them. The ſecond circumſtance concerning the time of this worke is in reſpect of the men upon whom God will worke: and ſome he workes upon in their tender age, ſome in their riper yeares, and ſome in their old age, at all times God doth call ſome; and this is the circumſtance we will now grapple withall, and for this purpoſe I have choſen this part of the Parable; and in the Parable, as in all other Parables, beſides the outſide, and letter of the Parable, we muſt underſtand the ſence and meaning thereof. When therefore we heare in the parable of a vineyard, and of the maſter of the vineyard, and of the ſervants that were hired to worke in this vineyard, and of the ſeverall houres wherein they are hired; theſe are onely the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of the Parable, the meaning thereof is this; by vineyard is meant the Church of God, and by the Maſter of the vineyard is meant the Lord Ieſus, the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4393:99"/>hiring of the ſervants into the vineyard, is nothing elſe but the powerfull calling of poore ſinners by the worke of the Miniſtery, to the knowledge of the truth here, and happineſſe hereafter, and in that he calls ſome at one houre, and ſome at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the meaning is, that God calls ſome at one time, ſome at another; ſome in their tender yeares, ſome in their middle age, and ſome in their old age; ſome older, ſome younger: but that wee may underſtand the ſence of the Spirit, in theſe words, <hi>The third houre, the ſixth houre, ninth houre, and the eleventh houre:</hi> We muſt underſtand that the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Romanes</hi> uſed to divide their dayes, which conſiſted of twelve houres into foure parts, from ſixe to nine was one parcell of the day, from nine to twelve was the ſecond, from twelve to three was the third part, and from three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone till ſixe at night was the laſt parcell of the day. Now therefore the third houre was nine of the clocke, the ſixt houre was twelve of the clocke, the ninth houre was three of the clocke in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, and the eleventh houre was five of the clocke, an houre before night. Now the Lord doth provide ſome ſoules for himſelfe at nine a clocke in the morning, ſome at three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, and ſome at the laſt caſt, at five of the clocke when the Sunne beginns to ſet; in their old decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit age the Lord meant to convert ſome unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Some underſtand this parable of the calling of Miniſters, good and bad, and in that it is ſaid here, <hi>They were hired every one for a penny;</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4393:99"/>by this, that ſome will be Miniſters for this living, ſome for that, ſome for preferment, ſome alſo come into the Miniſtery for the ſalvation of ſoules: but this cannot be the meaning of the Text here, and the reaſon is this. This Parable muſt be underſtood of thoſe men of whom the laſt clauſe in the 19. Chapter is underſtood; in the 30. Verſe of the 19. Chapter, the Text ſaith, <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> Now this Parable is ſet downe here in the beginning of this Chapter, and brought in by the Spirit of God meerely for the manifeſtation of the Scripture go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before; therefore it is cleare that this Parable is to be underſtood concerning thoſe perſons ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before in the former Chapter. Of thoſe alſo this Parable muſt be underſtood to whom it is applied afterward in the 16, Verſe of this Chapter, it is ſaid alſo, <hi>The laſt ſhall be firſt; and the firſt ſhall be laſt.</hi> So that the caſe is cleare, this Parable being brought in by the Spirit for the illuſtration &amp; diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the former truth, therefore who ever they be that were there underſtood, and whoever they be to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Parable is afterward applied, of the ſame the Parable here muſt be underſtood; but it is cleare, that that Verſe muſt be underſtood of thoſe that are gracious, for the Text ſaith in the 29. verſe of the former Chapter, <hi>Every one that have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken houſes or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife or children, or lands for my name ſake ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred fold, but many that are last ſhall be firſt, and many that be first ſhall be laſt,</hi> that is, they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4393:100"/>that are firſt called if they truſt unto themſelves ſhall be laſt rewarded, and they that are laſt called if they renounce themſelves and goe out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall be firſt rewarded, &amp; then preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes this parable as a manifeſtation of that truth, and this is the interpretation of the words. So that now wee ſee the meaning of the Parable. The Doctrine is, That God can and doth call in all ages, ſome in their yonger age, ſome in their riper yeares, and ſome in their old age; God calls ſome in all ages, but moſt and moſt uſually before their old age; this is that wee ſhall obſerve here in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the Lord calleth at the third, ſixe, and ninth houre, but at the eleventh houre he went out occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally not thinking to ſee any ſtanding idle at that time of the day, it was ſtrange and unexpected to ſee any then idle, no man would hire any man to worke in his vineyard for one houre, and therefore the text ſaith, <hi>he asked them, Why ſtand you here idle?</hi> As who ſhould ſay, hee did not once expect to ſee any idle at that time. For the explaning of the Doctrine there are two parts of it, wee will handle them ſeverally, that we may perceive our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the better. The firſt part is this, That God doth and can call ſeverall of his ſervants at ſeverall times: Secondly, That God doth call moſt, and moſt uſually before their old age. Firſt to beginne with the former, That God can, doth, and hath called ſeverall of his ſervants at ſeverall times, ſome in their younger age, ſome in their older, ſome in their tender yeares, ſome in their riper age; he calls
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4393:100"/>them when hee ſeeth it moſt agreeable to his good pleaſure; we ſhall obſerve that of <hi>Timothy</hi> that he was called in his tender yeares, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note>There ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Thou haſt knowne the Scriptures from a child, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and therefore the Apoſtle tells us in the ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>that he was nouriſhed up in the Word,</hi> that is, he was made ſtrong with the milke of the wholeſome Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.12.<note place="margin">1 King, 18.12.</note> It is ſaid that <hi>Obadiah feared God from his youth;</hi> and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.</note> It is ſaid of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he carried himſelfe ſo blameleſſe from his youth that hee was without all exception. So much to prove that ſome are called in their younger age; now we have examples of many alſo that were converted in their middle age, as that of the Iaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.37. and that of <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16.14.<note place="margin">Acts 16.37.</note> and the converſion of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. and of <hi>Zacheus,<note place="margin">Acts 16.14.</note> Acts</hi> 19. It is very probable that all theſe were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their middle age; for it is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſhe was a ſeller of purple, and that ſhee got her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby; and the Iaylor, it is like he was in his middle age, for he had a great charge of priſoners committed unto him; and <hi>Paul</hi> was in his prime when he was converted, for a long time after hee was converted, hee continued a great inſtrument to ſet forth Gods glory: and <hi>Zacheus</hi> hee was a tole gatherer, and had gotten a good eſtate by that meanes. By this it appeareth that God did call theſe about their middle age. Now for old age, I muſt confeſſe it is true that there is not any pregnant example in Scripture of Gods hand this way:<note place="margin">Gen 12.4.</note> we know, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.4. compared with <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 24.2. <note place="margin">Ioſhua 24.2.</note> that

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull was an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that God called him at 75. yeares old, but <hi>Abraham</hi> lived 175 yeares, to that <hi>Abraham</hi> was but in his middle age when he was called; but for any pregnant example, the Scripture is marvellous ſparing this way: onely that which may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by probabilitie and may be gathered, depends upon thoſe two places <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <note place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note>there were 3000 ſoules added to the Church by the preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 10. It is ſaid that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had got all his kindred and acquaintance together againſt <hi>Peter</hi> came,<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> whom by the commandement of God he was ſent for; and the text ſaith when <hi>Peter</hi> came, they were all gathered together to heare the Doctrine of life &amp; ſalvation; &amp; that while <hi>Peter</hi> was inſpeaking, the holy Ghoſt fell upon them all; now Divines reaſon thus, it is marvellous probable, that among thoſe 3000 which were converted by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſome of them were aged men; and when <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> had gotten all his kindred and acquaintance together, and the holy Ghoſt fell upon them all: there were, it is very likely, ſome aged men among them whom God was pleaſed to ſhew mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, we know theſe things may be, and there is good probabilitie of it, and wee ſee it out of the Text plainely, that God may call ſome in their old age; for he called ſome at the eleventh houre when it was almoſt night, but he hath reſerved this power in his owne hands, he hath left no pregnant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof in the Scripture that we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it; ſo then we ſee that God doth, and can, and hath called ſeverall of his ſervants, at ſeverall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4393:101"/>times, ſome at the third houre, ſome at the ſixt, ſome at nine, and ſome, though few at the eleventh houre; and the reaſon of the Point is double, why, the Lord doth deale thus in this caſe, hee doth not alwayes chuſe young men that are ſtrong, nor old men that are grave and wiſe; the ground of it is, that he might expreſſe the freeneſſe of his favour in Ieſus Chriſt, as if he ſhould proclaime to the world that we could doe nothing of our ſelves this way, that we have nothing in us that can move God to ſhew mercy unto us, but that it is out of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his love in Ieſus Chriſt; for ſhould God call onely children, middle aged men, or old men onely, then men would conceive that there were ſomething in the perſons that moved him to this, either the weakeneſſe of the child, or elſe the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie thereof did move God to ſhew mercy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or elſe that God did delight in the ſtrength or in the gifts and parts of a young man, or if he ſhould call men in their old age onely, then men might thinke that their experience and gravitie did move God to call them onely; but when God calleth ſome in all ages and at all times, ſome young ones choſen, and ſome refuſed, ſome old men called, and others caſt aſide; then all men may conceive that there is nothing in the perſons or parts of men, but that it proceedes all from the freeneſſe of Gods mercy that he deales thus with the ſoules of poore ſinners; it is the reaſon of that paſſage in the 15. verſe of this Chapter, there the Maſter of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard called the labourers together, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every man a penny; now they that came
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4393:102"/>firſt and had borne the heate of the day, when they ſaw that they which came laſt had as much as they, they murmured againſt the maſter of the vineyard ſaying, Theſe laſt have wrought but one houre, and thou haſt made them equall unto us which have borne the heate of the day, but then the maſter anſwered ſaying, Friend I doe thee no wrong, is it not lawfull for me to doe what I will with mine owne? as if he had ſayd, I called thee at the third houre, and him at the ſixth houre, and this man at the eleventh houre, it was out of my mercy that I called thee, and out of my mercy that I called him, is it not lawfull to doe what I will with mine owne; mercy is mine, and love is mine, and reward is mine, it is my mercy that I will call any at any time, and therefore I may diſpoſe of it as I pleaſe. Secondly as the Lord doth expreſſe hereby the freeneſſe of his grace, ſo the Lord alſo hereby doth mervelouſly magnifie his great power and All-ſufficiency in ſaving the ſoules of poore people, that is able to doe what hee will in heaven and in earth; and ſo likewiſe in the hearts of his ſervants, there are many little ones that are fooles and have no knowledge and yet the Lord is able to convert them and make them underſtand the myſteries of ſalvation, there are many ſtrong men that ſnuffle up the wind like the Aſſe in the Wilderneſſe, they will not ſtoope, they will not be humbled, but they will doe what they liſt, and yet the Lord is able to over power this ſturdy heart of a young and ſtrong man, and he is able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weake nature of a young one. And ſo men that are weatherbeaten in their ſinnes and ſcrewed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4393:102"/>into their corruptions, God is able to overpower theſe, and convert theſe alſo and bring them home unto himſelfe, if hee be a weake ſilly child, yet God is able to inlighten him, if hee have a ſturdy heart, yet God can bring him downe, and if he be a weatherbeaten and an old ſinner, yet God is able to call him and convert him alſo; and hereby the wonderfull power of the Lord is ſeene, in that hee is able to worke how hee will, when hee will, and upon whom he will in this kind; looke as it is with a Phyſitian, when a man hath a diſeaſe which lies low in his body and breedes rottenneſſe in his bones, inſomuch that it is almoſt paſt cure, then the Phyſitian that can recover this man ſheweth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable skill, and he ſheweth admirable power in regard that he is able to provide ſuch meanes, and apply ſuch meanes as thereby the party may bee cured; by this meanes the skill of the Phyſitian and the power of him is magnified, ſo it is with this great God, when all ſorts of ſinners are called, and all corruptions ſubdued, your little ones that know nothing yet God inlightens them and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them, <hi>Timothy</hi> did ſucke the ſincere milke of the Goſpel on one ſide, as he did ſucke the milke of his mothers breſts on the other ſide; and then there is a ſtubborne heart on another ſide, which breakes all bonds and ſnappes all cords apeeces, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We come now to the next paſſage, and that is this, however the Lord doth at ſeverall times convert ſeverall of his ſervants, and there is no time alotted to him, yet moſt and moſt uſually God doth call them before their old age, and that ſome interpreters wittily obſerve out of the Text, it is ſayd that the maſter of the Vineyard went out at the third, ſixt and ninth houre, and ſaw ſome ſtanding idle, and he ſent them into his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; he went then on purpoſe to ſee and hire, and ſend in Labourers to work in his Vineyard, but the Text ſaith, he went out at the eleventh houre not to hire any, for he did not expect to ſee any then idle, but hee went out upon ſome other occaſion, and ſeeing ſome then ſtanding idle hee wondred at it and ſayd, Why ſtand yee all the day idle, as if he ſhould ſay, no man will hire you now, it is but one houre to night, it is time for men to leave working, and not to beginne to worke, he went out occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and meeting with theſe unexpected, hee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at theſe and therefore they obſerve, that if there had not beene great mercy in the maſter of the Vineyard, this was no time to hire Labourers in, ſo that the caſe is cleare, ſome are called in their youth, ſome in their middle age, ſome in their old age, ſome in their tender yeares, ſome in their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age, ſome old, ſome young, but this is moſt true than thoſe whom God doth call it is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their middle age before they come to their old age, this is the generall courſe of God, he call many before, ſome after, but moſt then, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:4393:103"/>there the wiſe man obſerves, that there is a time appointed for every purpoſe, and it appeareth that the middle age is the fitteſt time for this purpoſe, it is true indeede that all things depend upon Gods will, but yet there is wiſedome in this God, and he ordereth things according to wiſe dome, and this ſeemes to bee the fitteſt ſeaſon wherein the Lord ſhould deale thus graciouſly in converting of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; if wee conſider either the nature of man, or the end of Gods giving grace, in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, firſt if wee looke to man, and regard either the conſtitution of his body or the gifts &amp; qualities of his minde, we ſhall ſee that it is moſt fit for God to worke upon him in his middle age, he can doe it, and may doe it at another time, but that is the fitteſt time; and that firſt in regard of the conſtitution of his body, for it is obſerved by Philoſophers that a man in his tender infancie lives the life of a tree onely, he onely eates and growes, and ſo it is with little children in their ſwadling cloathes, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he comes into further yeares, when he comes to be ten or twelve yeares old, then hee lives the life of a beaſt, he is taken away with thoſe objects that are then moſt ſutable to him; for a child to conſider of the myſteries of life &amp; ſalvation is almoſt impoſſible, he is not yet come to that ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of judgement, but when he comes to the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his yeares, from 20. years untill he come to be 40. or thereabouts, then the workes of reaſon put forth themſelves, then his apprehenſion is quick to conceive a thing, and his memory is ſtrong and pregnant to retaine a thing apprehended, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:4393:104"/>his heart is ſomewhat plyable, and his heart is ſomewhat frameable to receive that impreſſion that is put upon him; now becauſe in a mans mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle yeares abilitie of nature comes on, and reaſon comes on, inſomuch that a man is able to conceive and partake of the things of grace, and fadom them, and the power of his underſtanding comes on whereby he is able to embrace them, therefore then is the fitteſt time that God ſhould beſtow his graces upon a man, looke as it is with waxe, if a man melt it, it will be too ſoft to hold any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and when it is too hard it will receive no ſeale neither, but when it is neither too ſoft nor too hand but in a middle temper betweene them both, then it is fit and ready to receive any impreſſion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man ſtampes upon it, it muſt neither be too extremely hot nor too hard, but mediatly diſpoſed, and then it will receive a ſeale, ſo it is with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, in his tender yeares hee can hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he hath ſuch a weake underſtanding; tell a child of the wonders of ſalvation, and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unleſſe God workes wonderfully that hee ſhould receive them; a mans nature in his infancie is like wax that is too ſoft, and the nature of an old man that alſo is like wax too hard, but now a middle aged man is neither ſo weake as the one, nor ſo hard as the other, but it is moſt fit for God to put a ſtamp upon, for his heart is then moſt plyable to receive the things of grace, and his affections are then moſt frameable to the minde of the Lord. Secondly, as this is the fitteſt time for God to worke upon a man in regard of the conſtitution of his body, ſo alſo in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:4393:104"/>regard of corruption, becauſe a young man that is come to the ſtrength of his yeares, his minde will be ſooner informed, and his judgement ſooner convinced in regard of thoſe corruptions that are in him, becauſe hee hath not continued long in any baſe courſe, therefore hee is moſt eaſy to bee wrought upon, but when a man is growne old in wickedneſſe, when his ſoule as his body begins to buckle under the ſinnes of his younger yeares, when the heart is hardned, and the conſcience ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in wickedneſſe, then it is deſperately hard, it is a mervelous miracle for the meanes of ſalvation to take place in ſuch a man, wee ſee it is marvelous hard to drive a naile into an old knotty ſnarly poſt, eſpecially when it is weatherbeaten and ſeaſoned, and clung together. It is no wonder that we ſpend our hearts and can doe no good, for thoſe that have beene old weatherbeaten ſinners, knotty ſnarly, ſtubborne rebellious hearts, a man were as good ſpeak to the ſeats where they ſit, and to the walls as to the hearts of them, it is marvelous hard to bring any thing home to the affections of ſuch men, they will not away from their old corruptions, their hearts are rivited to their old luſts and corruptions, and therefore they will not entertaine that which may doe good unto them, if a man will tranſplant a tree, he doth not take an old withered rotten tree, that is not fit to bee tranſplanted, but hee takes a young tender twigge and tranſplants it, ſo it is here, thoſe old trees, old ſinners that are withering, dying and decaying, ſuch are of the Leapers ſpots, and Blackamoores hue, they that are ſetled in their corruptions, and reſolve to take up their old cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4393:105"/>now they are too old to learne, thus long they have lived, and if they be now ſtubborne they will be ſo ever; if they be now peeviſh and malicious they will be ſo ever; if they be now covetous they will be ſo ever, they will not entertaine, they will not partake of thoſe things which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their good. The third and laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in regard of grace it ſelfe; it is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and reaſonable that God ſhould beſtow grace upon thoſe that are in their middle age, rather than upon thoſe that are in their tender yeares, or in their old age, if we conſider the end of the giving of grace, for what is the end of grace, and why doth God give a man grace and frame his heart ſo, that he may be fitted to partake of happineſſe, but that the Lord hereby might receive the praiſe and glory of the riches of his grace? That they which have it may expreſſe the power of God, that hath called them out of darkeneſſe into marvellous light; the Lord is pleaſed to ſhew this favour towards them, that they might ſhew forth what God hath done to their poore ſoules, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth; now this middle age of a man is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time, wherein grace may receive moſt glory, and God moſt honour, in regard of the giving of it; for grace when it commeth to nature doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, but perfect it, it doth not take away the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parts, as learning, knowledge and courage, and the like, but rectifieth them and turneth them the right way: as for example, he that had a ſtrong memory, or a ſharpe wit, or a great courage, and a violent affection, God preſerveth and keepeth thoſe ſtill, but when grace comes God, turneth them the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4393:105"/>right way and maketh him a fit inſtrument to ſet forth his glory, that before was a great enemy to the ſame, and therefore it is ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen veſſell for the Lord, and why? becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> was a man of great learning, fiery zeale, fervent love, and undanted courage, and therefore when he perſecuted the Church, it is ſaid that hee breathed forth perſecutions; he got him a good Steed, &amp; got letters from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> &amp; haled all poore Chriſtians to priſon where he came, but when grace came, the Lord did ſtill retaine the naturall power of zeale, love, courage, and learning, the Lord did retaine all theſe; that tongue that before ſpake againſt God is now fitted to confute the adverſary, hee convinced them mightily ſaith the text, &amp; that courage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he before was carried againſt Gods Saints is, now fitted to ſuffer perſecution, impriſonment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for his names ſake, and therefore in all reaſon it was fitteſt that the Lord ſhould take <hi>Paul</hi> in the middle of thoſe yeares, that he might employ him to the furtherance of his praiſe, that had before beene a great hinderance to his Goſpell; It is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that the members of a godly mans body, and the faculties of his ſoule, are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of righteouſneſſe; a gracious tongue will ſpeake thoſe things which may be for Gods praiſe, and the good of men; a gracious foote will be ſwift to runne the wayes of Gods Commandements: now the wiſeſt, workeman will not chuſe an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is broken and unfit for ſervice; now an old man is a broken and crazie inſtrument, little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour can God have by his tongue when it faulters, little good can God have by his underſtanding, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4393:106"/>learning, and wiſedome, when as in regard of his age he is become a child againe, and therefore it is marvellous reaſonable that God ſhould take this time for the expreſſing of his grace; for when a man is in the ſtrength of nature, then grace turnes all the members of his body and faculties of his ſoule the right way, and a man runnes as earneſtly forward in a good courſe, as hee did before in the wayes of wickedneſſe; ſo then gather up the point, if in regard of the conſtitution of his body, a man is then fitteſt to receive the things of grace, if in regard of corruption he is not ſo hardened to reſiſt grace, if alſo then he is fitteſt to glorifie God for beſtowing grace upon him; then it is reaſonable, that as God can call when he will, ſo it is moſt fit that he ſhould call him before he is in his old declining age, when his body is fit for nothing but to be carried upon a coffin and laid into the grave; now we ſee then that it is cleare, God can call at any time, but God doth moſt uſually call moſt of his ſervants before their old age: Let us now ſee what uſe we can make of the Point; and firſt obſerve from hence a ground of Inſtruction; we muſt take heede that we be not too raſh &amp; giddily cenſorious, in ſetting downe a finall cenſure upon men; ſeeſt thou men running on head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the wayes of wickedneſſe, yet never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore that God will never ſhew mercy and favour unto them, and worke upon the ſoules of them, for we know that God can call at the eleventh houre, and therefore be not too raſh in cenſuring this way,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> but receive the exhortation of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.

                  </gap> of a Chriſtian, for if the heart bee but prepared, <hi>the Lord will then ſuddenly come into his Temple</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeakes.) Now this preparation conſiſts of two parts: Firſt, the diſpenſation of Gods gracious work upon the ſoule of a poore ſinner. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the frame and diſpoſition that God works upon the ſoule, in converting it to himſelfe. Vpon theſe two hangs the maine work of preparation: and herein lyeth the great drift of a Chriſtian; for the mercy of God is very <hi>free,</hi> but we cannot make men fit to receive this mercy. And therefore in preparation hereunto, wee muſt apprehend two things: ſomewhat muſt prepare; ſecondly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what muſt be prepared: he that doth prepare, is the Lord; he that doth receive the work, and is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is the ſoules of thoſe whom God hath elected to ſalvation: So that as I ſaid before, ſomething on Gods part muſt bee obſerved, ſomething on mans part muſt be conſidered: on Gods part the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his work, and on mans part the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is wrought in the ſoule.

                  </gap> God worketh upon the ſoule when hee prepares <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> himſelfe; and this diſcovereth it ſelfe in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: we will handle them both together. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God doth pluck a poore ſinner from his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and darling ſinnes, to which he was glued and faſtned: and ſecondly, as he draweth the ſoule from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4393:110"/>ſinne, ſo he draweth it to himſelfe to beleeve in him, and to receive mercy from him. Firſt God plucks the ſoule from ſinne: ſecondly he drawes it to the Lord Ieſus. And for this purpoſe wee have choſen this text, that ſo we may have ſome footing for that which we ſpeak out of Scripture, and my purpoſe, is not to handle all particulars in the Text, which are many, but to chooſe thoſe that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our preſent purpoſe, and beſt fit us in our proceeding. And the two maine points which I meane to diſcover out of the Text are theſe: Firſt, that every man in his naturall condition is faſtened and ſettled in the ſtate of ſinne and corruption. Secondly, that the Lord by a holy kind of violence plucks off the ſoule from ſin, and draweth it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Theſe are the two things which in the Text I aime at, but the ſecond is the main thing I look at: &amp; we muſt handle them both, becauſe the drawing of a thing from another implyeth that the thing which is drawn was faſtned to ſome thing from whence it is to be drawne; and therefore when the Lord ſaith, he will draw a poore ſinner to himſelfe, it implyes that wee were ſtuck faſt and glued to our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from whence we muſt be drawne; and when this is once done, then the face is towards heaven, towards <hi>Zion;</hi> then it is fitted to receive mercy from the Lord Ieſus: and becauſe this drawing unto God doth imply a faſtning of the ſoule unto ſinne, from whence it muſt be drawne, the point therefore is this; namely, that every mans naturall eſtate and condition is faſtned, and ſettled, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4393:111"/>to his ſinnes and corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by nature is not onely ingrafted into ſinne, but he is rooted into the rebellions of <hi>Adam,</hi> and is growne ſtrong with ſinfull corruptions and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of his owne ſoule; nay a man is not able to expreſſe the ſtrong combination, betweene ſinne and the ſoule; it is ſcrued into ſinne, and riveted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corruptions, which have beene convaied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto and derived from our firſt parents: and that the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>le is thus faſtned, and ſettled, and glued to ſinne, wee may obſerve it in two particulars; Partly in the dominion that ſinne and Satan hath over the ſoule: Partly in the amity that the ſoule hath to ſinne. Firſt then, conſider the dominion that ſinne hath over the ſoule, that ſoveraigne and uncontroulable command which ſinne exerciſeth over the ſoule of every poore creature under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is in a naturall eſtate, in the bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and under the power of Satan; and we ſhall ſee that the ſoule is faſtened to ſinne, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. the text ſaith, that they are under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>To open their eyes,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>that they may turne from darkneſſe to light, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan to God.</hi> If you aske me how the Devill hath power over poore ſinners, the Apoſtle telleth you, <hi>That he catcheth them at his pleaſure:</hi> the proud man muſt go no further than he will, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man muſt do nothing but that which he liſt: but this is not all neither, though this be ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the power that Satan hath over the ſoule of a ſinner: but when hee hath thus taken a poore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4393:111"/>ſoule, and fettered him in this caſe, he then ſhuts him up in priſon, <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.26. there the next ſaith, that the divell takes poore ſinners, priſoners at his will. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. it is ſaid, that all men by nature are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, ſhut up under ſinne: it is a phraſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from priſoners; a priſoner that is under the hand of the jaylor, and hath his legges ſettered, and is ſhut up in priſon, we uſe to ſay that ſuch a man is ſure enough. And not only ſo; ſinne and Satan have not only taken a poore priſoner, and ſettered him, and ſhut him up in priſon, but they <hi>have ſlaine him, and taken away his life</hi> alſo; and therefore now ſinne muſts needs he faſtened deep in the ſoule of a poore ſinner. If a theefe, or a Traytor, were apprehended, and convicted, and impriſoned, and had bolts and fetters upon him; and further, if he were condemned, and hang'd, drawne, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; then though the partie were never ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, or his practiſes never ſo outragious, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The devill hath not only taken a poore ſinner, but he hath fetterd him and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4393:112"/>him, and taken away his life; and therefore now the devill hath him ſure enough, as we may ſo ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the dominion of ſinne over the ſoule is great, ſo alſo that ſame land of league, and cloſe kind of firme faſtning, that ſame union that is betweene the ſoule and corruptions, is marvellous great. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never enough expreſſeth the love that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſinne and the ſoule; look what love and union there is between the husband and the wiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi>

The poynt is this, the Lord by a holy kind of violence, doth pluck the hearts of ſinners from ſinne, unto himſelfe, this is the ſcope of the text, and this is the ayme of our Saviour in the verſel, and this is the work, on Gods part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: for as we have heard before, we muſt obſerve two things in preparation; Firſt Gods act upon the ſoule, Secondly the frame and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that is wrought in the ſoule by God. The act of God is a drawing of the ſoule by an holy kind of violence, from ſinne unto himſelfe. I will not here ſpeak of the inability of the ſoule, or that God is the author of this work, for theſe I have handled before, out of that place, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11.19. it is <hi>God that taketh away the ſtony heart, and giveth a heart of fleſh:</hi> we will only now ſpeak, of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4393:118"/>of the work of God, of the manner how God prepares a ſinner for himſelfe, and the text ſaith, he doth it by <hi>drawing,</hi> he doth by a holy kind of violence, draw the ſoule from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſinnefull courſes, unto himſelfe; and I will handle both theſe together, the pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſoule from finne, and drawing of it to God, becauſe they are both made up together, by one action and motion; as for example, look as it is with a man, that rends one peece of wood from another, as he plucks the one peece from the other, ſo he drawes that which he plucks to himſelfe, he doth not only draw it from the other, but he drawes that part, neerer to himſelfe; ſo that both are made up, by one action and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo it is here, the plucking of a ſinner from corruption, and drawing of him to God, both theſe are acted by God at once, and therefore I will handle them both together; only obſerve, there muſt be ſuch a kind of thing as this is, before God will take poſſeſſion of the ſoule, namely, there muſt be a ſevering of the ſoule from ſinne, and a drawing of it to God; look as it is with a mans body, if any part thereof be out of joynt, or broken, before this part can be jonted aright againe, haply there is ſome filth, ſome moyſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours about it, or haply there is ſome dead fleſh in it, now this dead fleſh muſt be taken away, and the filth and ill humours muſt be removed, before that part can be ſet in its right place againe; ſo it muſt be with the ſoules of Gods ſervants, every
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4393:119"/>ſoule by ſinne is unjoynted, and wholly removed from God: the ſoule indeed was made for God, and ſhould have cloſed with him, and faſtened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but by reaſon of ſinne, the ſoule is quite broken; now before the ſoule can be made fit for God, before it can be put into a right frame, all that noyſome corruption that is in it, and thoſe baſe luſts that hang upon it, the ſoule muſt be freed from theſe, before God can work upon it, or that receive mercy and ſalvation from God, before it can performe any good duty; and this is done by drawing: the Lord by a holy kind of violence, doth pluck the ſoule from thoſe ſinnes that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in it, and thoſe diſtempers that preſſe upon it, and then he drawes it unto himſelfe. And for the opening of this, we muſt conſider three things: Firſt, what the nature of this drawing is, what is meant hereby. Secondly the meanes how, and whereby God commeth to draw a poore ſinner, from ſinne to himſelfe. Thirdly, the arguments why God muſt thus draw with a holy kind of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and that God may do this without any prejudice at all to the will. Firſt, what the nature of this drawing is; and we muſt underſtand, that there is a double kind of drawing in Scripture, this word implyeth a double ſenſe in the phraſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a there is firſt a morall kind of drawing, it is a word uſed by Divines, but that I may ſpeak to the capacity of all, I will terme it an outward or an externall kind of drawing, which is this, when a man by reaſons propounded, and good
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4393:119"/>things offered to the underſtanding and the will, comes thereby to have his mind enlightned, and his will moved and perſwaded, to embrace and give entertaynment to the things offered: and obſerve in this two things; firſt, that it is only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in regard of the ſubject; ſecondly, that it putteth nothing into the heart, but ſtirreth up that which is in the heart already: there is nothing but objects offered, and arguments propounded to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſoule to the love and liking of the thing offered; and this is uſuall in Scripture, and it is ſaid to bee a compelling of a man; it propounds argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the ſoule, and ſo brings on the ſoule to the affecting of any thing; in the 16 of the <hi>Acts</hi> 15. it is ſaid of <hi>Lydia</hi> after ſhee was converted, her ſoule clave to the holy man <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſhe beſought them ſaying; <hi>If you have judged me to bee faithfull to the Lord, abide in my houſe:</hi> and then ſaith the text, <hi>ſhe conſtrayned us,</hi> ſhee laid ſuch hookes upon them that ſhee conſtrayned them, how is this? ſhee layd no violent hands upon them, no, but ſhee uſed arguments that were ſo forcible, and reaſons that were ſo pithy, that ſhe perſwaded the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe that were with him to yeeld unto her requeſt: <hi>if you have judged me faithfull come into my houſe;</hi> as if ſhee had ſayd, if you beleeve that I have received the grace of God by you, if ever you meanes to receive any comfort from the bleſſing of God upon the worke wrought in me by your meanes, if you think that my ſoule hath been made partaker of any good from you, come then in unto
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4393:120"/>my houſe and abide with me; now unleſſe <hi>Paul</hi> would have denyed his owne work which God by his grace had ſhewed him, he muſt yeeld unto her, and come in, and therefore the text ſaith, that <hi>ſhee conſtrayned him,</hi> that is, ſhee did by arguments and reaſons propounded unto him, perſwade him to grant her requeſt: ſo in the 22 of <hi>Matt.</hi> it is ſayd that the King when he had made a great feaſt, and thoſe that were bidden would not come, he bids his ſervants go out into the high wayes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to come in; there is nothing meant there but this morall, outward drawing by ſtrength of arguments, when by arguments propounded, we draw and perſwade men, to do that we would have them performe: but this is not meant here in the text, and I prove it thus, becauſe it is not the purpoſe of our Saviour Chriſt in the text, for Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taught a ſpirituall and an heavenly Sermon, the Phariſees murmured and ſaid, <hi>Is not this Ieſus the ſonne of Ioſeph, whoſe father and mother we know, how is it then that he ſaith, he came down from heaven?</hi> Ieſus when he perceived their murmuring, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Why murmur you among your ſelves?</hi> and that he might prevent the offence that the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones might take at the example of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, he ſaith unto them, <hi>No man can come unto me, except my father draweth him,</hi> as though he had ſaid, be not you troubled, and perplexed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe great ſcollers do not beleeve my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and embrace it, it is not in them willing, but in mee drawing; do not you think ill of my
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4393:120"/>doctrine of ſalvation, becauſe your wiſe men and your brave men, will not beleeve it; for I tell you, though theſe have had arguments propounded, to perſwade them to this, yet they cannot embrace my doctrine and beleeve, unleſſe my father draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; they have had their hearts convinced and their mouths ſtopped, but yet all this will not do, unleſſe my father draweth them. Secondly, this kind of caution, except my father draweth him, no man come unto mee, is implyed, that if my father doth draw him, he will come; and the Papiſts themſelves confeſſe this, that a man may have this morall drawing arguments, perſwading, and reaſons alluring to come unto God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy from him, and yet he may not come; but they that have this drawing meant in the text, they will undoubtedly come; <hi>no man comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, except the father which hath ſent mee draweth him,</hi> and therefore whoſoever the father doth draw, he ſhall come, and certainly will come, and therefore this drawing, that is meant here, is not a morall drawing by outward perſwaſions: thus much for the clearing of this poynt, namely that a morall and externall drawing is not to be underſtood in the text. This will not ſerve the turne, there is more in it than ſo, we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſearch further, into the nature of this word drawing; and God is ſaid to draw a poore ſinner unto himſelfe, in the ſecond place, when he is not only pleaſed to enlighten a mans mind, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer arguments to his underſtanding, and lay truths
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4393:121"/>and propound promiſes unto him, for this will not doe it, this is only an outward drawing; but when the Lord is pleaſed to put a new power into the ſoule of a ſinner, and with all, to carry the will to the object propounded, that it may embrace it; when God is pleaſed, not onely to offer good things to the ſoule, but to enable the ſoule to lay hold upon the things offered, not only to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt and ſalvation, but to work effectually upon the heart, and make it able to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to Chriſt, then the Lord is ſaid to draw a ſinner unto himſelfe, from ſinne and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is tearmed an internall kind of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and this is meant here in the text, it is not only the propounding of arguments, to move and pluck the ſoule, but the Lord doth by his effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power, draw the ſoule from ſinne, and bring it unto himſelfe. And therefore obſerve two things, touching this internall drawing, namely, that there is a ſeperation firſt wrought, betweene ſinne and the ſoule, the union that is betweene finne and the ſoule, is broken. Secondly, that when the ſoule is once ſevered, and broken off from ſinne, then it comes to a right ſet, to a right frame and diſpoſition towards God, and then it goeth no further, but here it ſtoppeth; and this is that which I call plucking and drawing of a poore ſinner from his corruptions to God, in both which actions the will of the creature is wrought upon, plucked from ſinne and ſet towards God, and of it ſelfe it doth not move at all. I expreſſe it thus, look as it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4393:121"/>is with the wheele of a clock, or the wheele of a Iack that is turned aſide, and by ſome contrary poyſe ſet the wrong way. He now that will ſet this wheele right, muſt take away the contrary poyſe, and then put the wheele the right way, and and yet the wheele doth not goe all this while of it ſelfe, but firſt there is a ſtopping of the wheele, and a taking away of the poyſe: and ſecondly the wheele muſt be turned the right way, and all this while the wheele is only a ſufferer; ſo it is with the ſoule of a man, the heart of a man, and the will of a man, and the affections of a man, they are the wheeles of the ſoules of men, the Lord Ieſus made them at the firſt to runne to heaven-ward, and to God-ward, but when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, then the poyſe of corruptions prevailed ſo farre forth over them, that they drew the heart, the mind, the will of man from God, and made it runne the wrong way to the divell-ward, and to hell-ward; now when the Lord commeth to ſet theſe wheeles aright, he muſt take away the poyſe and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met that made them runne the wrong way, that is, the Lord by his almighty power, muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power thoſe ſinnes and corruptions which harbour in the ſoule, and have dominion over the ſoule: as for example, if a man have a covetous heart, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the world will not ſuffer him to heare, and pray, and performe any good duty, then God muſt pull away that plummet, he muſt pluck the ſoule from that ſinne, and then he muſt draw it to himſelfe, that is, he muſt draw it to Godward, and to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4393:122"/>Zion-ward, and make it to be at his command, that Gods ſpirit as a new plummet, may carry it and order it, and now it doth nothing all this while, God muſt firſt take away the contrary plummet, that drew the ſoule aſide, and then the frame of the ſoule will be to God-ward, it will be in a right frame and order, it will runne the right way, and all this while the will is only a ſufferer, and this I take to be the meaning of the text: That God by a holy kind of violence, rendeth the ſoule of a poore ſinner, and withall by his almighty power, ſtops the force of a mans corruptions, and makes the ſoule teachable, and framable to the will of God, it makes it to lie levell, and to be at Gods command, and this is done by a holy kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and ſo much for theſe poynts of ſpeculation, without which I could not well open the poynt. But now we ſee the bottome of the poynt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God doth by a holy kind of violence, pluck and draw men from their corruptions, unto himſelfe. The next thing to be conſidered is, the meanes whereby God thus haleth the ſoule, and draweth the heart of a poore ſinner unto himſelfe: and the meanes are foure.<note n="1" place="margin">1.</note> The firſt work of the Lord is this he lets in a light into the foule of a poore ſinner, and diſcovereth unto him, that he is in a wrong way, and tells him, there is another way that he muſt walk in, if ever he meane to come to heaven, and this is the firſt meanes, when the ſoule of a ſinner is inlightned, and his mind infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he is in a wrong courſe, and that he muſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4393:122"/>take a better courſe, or elſe he ſhall never come at heaven, and this the Lord doth ſuddenly, the ſinner not perceiving of it, the Lord ſetteth a ſudden flaſh upon his ſoule, and telleth him that he is going unto hell, the ſoule preſently wonders at this, and marvels how it came to paſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.1. there ſaith the text, <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for mee, and I am found of them that ſought mee not,</hi> the Lord putteth a ſudden light into ſoules of men, which they never dreamed of. Hypocrites if they can but goe to Church, and ſit in the Church as Gods ſervants do, and leane on their elbowes, and heare as Gods people do, then all is well with them, but as many of them as belong to God, God will diſcover unto them that they are in a wrong way, and he will ſhew and reveale another way unto them, which they never dreamed of; and therefore this is that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall obſerve, haply we ſhall ſee a man come ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into a town on a Sabboth day, and when he comes, there hee ſeeth the people going to Church, well, perhaps then he ſets up his horſe at the Inne, and goes into the Church for a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and for company ſake, and when he is in the Church, he goes into a ſeat and ſets down his ſtaffe, and ſits down and attends the Miniſter, and never thinks of any thing, well at laſt the Lord ſends a light into his ſoule, and telleth him, thou art now riding about thy own worldly buſineſſe, when thouſhouldſt be in ſanctifying of my Sabboth: I tell thee my friend, thou art in a wrong way,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4393:123"/>thou takeſt a naughty courſe, thou doſt wickedly, and if thou continueſt and goeſt on in this courſe, thou wilt never come at heaven. And this the Lord doth on a ſudden, when a man never ſo much as thought of any ſuch matter. And after a man is thus enlightned, he will be ready to ſay, the truth is, heretofore I went to heare the word but for cuſtomes ſake, but when I leaſt dreamed of any ſuch thing, it pleaſed the Lord, bleſſed be his name, to reveale ſuch things unto mee, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never knew, he told mee that which ſticketh upon mee to this preſent houre, he diſcovered that unto mee, which I hope I ſhall carry with me unto my grave; this is that we may obſerve in the 9. of the <hi>Acts, Paul</hi> there was running on in a reſolute-courſe, he had gotten letters at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and purpoſed to make havock of all poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians where he came, now while he was in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the Lord met him from heaven, and cryed unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee?</hi> as he if had ſaid, this is not the way to heaven, you think to perſecute my poore Saints, but <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> I tell thee, this is not the way, thou takeſt a wrong courſe: he called unto him, as a man would call after one that is running out of his right way, into ſome wilderneſſe or dangerous place. And when <hi>Saul</hi> heard this, he preſently fell off his horſe, and humbled himſelfe and ſaid, <hi>Lord what wilt thou that I do?</hi> and ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. the text ſaith, that the ſhepherd that had loſt his ſheep left his ninty and nine, and went into the wilderneſſe to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4393:123"/>ſeek that which was loſt, and if he had not gone to ſeek the ſheep, the ſheep would never have ſought him: alas the poore ſheep was gone aſtray, and bewilderd, and if the ſhepheard had not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it and ſought after it, that would never have found the ſheepheard; nay to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, many a man goeth to the word, and heareth it for nothing elſe but to carp at the Miniſter, and yet the Lord hath caught many ſuch men alſo, and hath put ſuch a light into their hearts, that he hath made them know that they were in a wrong way: and mark, when the Lord hath let in this light, then the ſoule begins to be at a ſtand, and thinks with himſelfe, ſurely if this be the right way, I am in the wrong, if the Miniſter ſaith true, then I am not right; but then ſometimes the heart would put out this light, it would not be informed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded; if the Miniſter tels a man that he muſt ſanctifie Gods Sabboths here, or elſe he ſhall never ſanctifie a Sabboth unto him in heaven hereafter, when the Miniſter ſaith, that unleſſe God humble us here, he will break us in peeces in hell hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; loath a man is to know this, and be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this, becauſe hee would not be offended by this and provoked to performe this, but though a ſinner would ſhift off this, yet the Lord will not leave him, but will ſtill purſue him and lay rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon him unanſwerable; the ſoule would fain play tricks with the Lord in this caſe, and put out this light, but God will reveale to the ſoule of a ſinner that theſe things are certainly true, God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4393:124"/>will lay hold upon the underſtanding of a poore ſinner, and follow him with reaſons that are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable untill his reaſon ſhall yeeld, and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding give verdit to that which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales, untill hee ſayes I, confeſſe Lord, it is true, I yeeld full aſſent thereto: Thus the Lord knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the doore or heart of a poore ſinner, and not only ſo, but lifts up the latch and opens the doore of a mans heart, and letteth in the light; and this is the firſt courſe that God uſeth.<note n="2" place="margin">2.</note> The ſecond is this, after that the Lord hath thus enlightened the minde and let in the light of his ſpirit into the heart of a ſinner, and though a man would defeat the power of it, yet God ſtill followeth him with forceable arguments untill the underſtanding is ſetled, and reaſon anſwered: after the Lord hath done this, then the ſecond cord wherewith God draweth ſinners unto himſelfe, is a cord of mercy, whereby the Lord doth compaſſe a poore ſinner about with kindneſſe, &amp; goodneſſe, and compaſſion, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. there ſaith the Lord, <hi>I taught Ephraim to goe, taking them by the armes, I drew them with the cords of love, and with the bonds of a man.</hi> This ſame cord of Gods mercy is a cable rope, the abundant riches of Gods mercy is a great thick cable, and we will tell you of what it is twiſted, &amp; it makes known it ſelfe in foure particulars; if the illumination that God ſends into the heart will not bee able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the heart, though it anſwers all objections &amp; purſueth it with arguments undeniable, why then the Lord will draw us with the cord of his mercy,

It is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that God ſhould command a ſinner for to come unto him, and that he ſhould be accepted when he doth come, but that God ſhould beſeech and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a poore ſinner to receive mercy, herein is diſcovered the incomprehenſible depth of Gods love, that the Lord ſhould beſeech us; oh that you would receive pardon for your ſinnes and bee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever; why this is wonderfull mercy, and admirable goodneſſe! if this Cord will not draw a man, what will do it? this makes a poore ſoule to ſtand agaſt, and amazed, and ſay, good Lord is this poſſible that the great King of Heaven ſhould come and beſeech ſuch a traytor, ſuch a rebell as I am to take pardon? if the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a pardon to ſome notorious Traytor that had plotted ſome dangerous treaſon againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this were much; but that the King ſhould lay downe his Crowne and come creeping to him, and beſeech him upon his knees to take mercy, and not

The Lord hee complaineth, <hi>why will ye die, as I live, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of a ſinner:</hi> the Lord takes an oath upon it, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires

Mercy is offered you, the Lord Ieſus reacheth out his hand to you to pluck the drunkard out of the alehouſe, and the adulterer out of the company of his whore; I tell you, you had beene better have beene at the Eaſt-Indies where you might never have heard of mercy, than ſlight it when it is offered: if you do break this cord, I know not what to ſay unto you, this is able to breake a mountaine in peeces, <hi>ſhake O moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, why, <hi>becauſe God hath redeemed Iacob;</hi> the redemption of <hi>Iacob</hi> was enough to ſhake a mountaine: when thou haſt been a great ſinner, and heaped up tranſgreſſion upon tranſgreſſion, and drunk in iniquity like water, why yet after all this the Lord offereth mercy unto thee, and beſeecheth thee to receive it; I tell thee, if thou wilt not have mercy now, it is pitty but thou ſhouldeſt goe to the Devill, and if thou doſt goe to hell, then thank thy ſelfe, it was thy owne fault; thou mighteſt have had mercy and wouldeſt not: and this is the third cord of Gods mercy, he intreats a poore ſinner to come unto him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy from him: but if the ſoule bee yet awke and untoward and will not come, but ſay, if mercy be ſo free, then we will let it alone a while, and take it hereafter; if God bee ſo carefull of us, then wee will bee a little careleſſe our ſelves: why then there remaines but one cord more, and if thou breakeſt this, thou art in a miſerable condition, and that is this:</p>

Firſt, conſcience is a warner of the ſoule, and admoniſheth the ſinner of his waies; this conſcience gives a ſinner an uncontrouleable command to come from ſinne, conſcience gives him a peremptory charge upon paine of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt judgement that can bee inflicted upon him, not to meddle with corruption; it is conſcience that doth this, the Lord ſtirreth up conſcience and armes him with authority as a Vicegerent under him, that he may ſtifle thoſe ſinfull luſts, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power thoſe ſinfull diſtempers that harbour in the ſoule, and overcome the ſoule: it is true, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men by reaſon that they live in ſinne, have their conſciences either blinded or aſleep, their conſciences oftentimes come to be ſeared and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened; wicked men have their conſciences ſome times under them, they ſtifle their conſcience and ſtop the mouth of conſcience; if conſcience offer to reproove them, they preſently take him on the mouth, and make him quiet; they bind the hands of conſcience in this kind, but if a wicked man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, then hee will awaken conſcience in this life, but if they do not belong unto him, then they may be ſure when they are in hell to have their conſciences awakened, they carry a black dogge in their boſome that will teare them with a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4393:130"/>witneſſe, but if God purpoſe good unto a man, then he will awaken his conſcience in this life, hee will arme conſcience with authority, and put a new commiſſion into the hand of conſcience, inſomuch, that now conſcience ſtands upon termes, and conſcience will not put it up as he hath done; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it hath heretofore beene ſtifled, yet now it gives men a peremptory command upon paine of their everlaſting torment, as they love their own ſoules, to take heed that they meddle not with ſin, for if they do, it will coſt them everlaſting life: now when conſcience hath ſuch a commanding power, then the command is marvellous awfull, terrible, and fearefull, and it maks a ſinner ſtart aſide and withdraw himſelfe from his former courſes, it makes him hang downe his head, and he dares not looke out of doores, he dares not runne with that courage into wicked practiſes as he did before: it is with conſcience in this caſe as it is with a Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or a Shreife of a countrey, happily in the Kings abſence a company of rebels joyne together in a conſpiracy and rend the commiſſion out of the Lievetenants hand, and beſet the Shreifes houſe; &amp; the officers, becauſe the rebels are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, dare doe little or nothing unto them, they may ſay as <hi>David</hi> did to the ſonnes of <hi>Serviah, ye are too ſtrong for me, ye ſonnes of Serviah;</hi> and therefore he would not meddle with them: and ſo in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly towne wee ſhall ſee a company of ryotous fellowes, becauſe they are more in number than the officers, they ſet the Conſtable in ſtockes, when
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4393:130"/>as they are more worthy to goe to the gallowes than he to the ſtocks: juſt ſo it is with conſcience, haply wicked men in former times have ſtifled conſcience, and tooke the comiſſion out of the hands of conſcience; but when the King comes into the countrey, and the officers ſhall complaine unto the King of this conſpiracy, then he gives them a larger command, and gives them more power, hee puts a new commiſſion into their hands, and furniſheth them with greater ayd, and commandeth upon paine of death that there be no more ſuch uproares made; and when this is proclaymed upon the Market-poſt, then this makes thoſe reſolute fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to pull in their heads, and they dare not ſhew themſelves: So it is with conſcience, ſometimes the Lord letts wicked men blind conſcience, and feare it; wicked men oftentimes make a mock at conſcience, if a man reprooves them for ſome ſin, and admoniſheth them for conſcience ſake not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit wicked practiſes, then they flout at the perſon that ſpeakes unto them, and ſay, what your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not ſuffer you to do as we do, you will not drink will you? why? oh your conſcience will not ſuffer you; you will not commit adultery will you? your conſcience will not ſuffer you; what you are a man of conſcience are you, and you will ſuffer your conſcience to make a foole of you? what care we for your conſcience, or you either: thus many ſinners keep conſcience under, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſcience be thus ſlighted and diſpiſed, the time will come when God will awaken conſcience,

Thus the divell by temptations on one ſide, and wicked men by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſwaſions on the other ſide, be leagure a poore ſoule; and the ſoule having ſome quiet, he begins to liſten to their perſwaſions, and then he beginnes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4393:135"/>to take up his old courſe, and follow his ſinnesmore violently, and with greater eagerneſſe than ever he did all his life time before: For mark that alwayes, if after God hath inlightned a mans mind and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his conſcience, he falls into his old wayes again, then he is a divell; he is twice as bad as he was before, he followes his corruptions with ſuch outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if hell were broken looſe. Very well, he hath now broken two hooks, the third hook is that which will rend him in peeces before it will let him paſſe: when conſcience ſeeth that the other two hooks are broken, when he ſeeth that commands prevaile not, that accuſations terrifie not, then the Lord exerciſeth another work of conſcience upon the heart of a poore ſinner, and that is this: As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did before command him, and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily charge him upon the hazzard of everlaſting life, not commit ſinne; and ſecondly, as it before did accuſe him before God, for the commiſſion of that ſinne, whereby God was diſhonourted, and his ſoule polluted: ſo in the third place, conſcience becomes his executioner, it takes the office of an executioner upon him, conſcience will beare with him no longer, but now draggs him down to the very place of execution: he was convicted before; conſcience ſayes unto him, thy ſinnes were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and I charged thee not to meddle with ſinne any more, upon paine of Gods diſpleaſure, and as thou wouldſt anſwer it before God: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I became an accuſer of thee before God, and then thou didſt confeſſe thy ſinnes, and didſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4393:136"/>amendment, but now ſince thou haſt ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my commands, and not regarded my accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there is therefore no remedy but thou muſt go to the place of execution: now there is no way but one with thee, now conſcience begins to condemne the ſoule; as Divines expreſſe theſe three works of conſcience, by a practicall kind of reaſoning, and conſcience reaſons thus with the ſoule. He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, he ſhall periſh, there is no remedic; there is the command of conſcience: but thou haſt often been reproved and admoniſhed, and yet haſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thy heart and haſt not been bettered by it, there is the work of accuſation, and therefore thou ſhalt periſh, there is no remedy; and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning work. Suppoſe conſcience ſhould come thus unto the heart of a man, he that being often reproved, hardeneth his heart he ſhall periſh, ſaith the Lord, there is no remedy: but now let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience go into every mans boſome, and reaſon thus with him, thou art the man, woman, or child, whom counſells in private, and reproofes, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and admonitions in publque would do no good; nothing would convince thee, nothing would informe thee; therefore thou ſhalt periſh, man, woman, or child, there is no remedic. Theſe are the three works of conſcience, and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath done this laſt work, and performed his office of execution, when he hath condemned a ſoule, and delivered a ſinner into the hand of the executioner, then it is thus with this ſinner: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4393:136"/>all mercies and cords of love will do no good, after the commands and accuſations will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, then conſcience ſayes, come damned ghoſts, take away this drunkard, this blaſphemer, this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, this contemner of my word, and throw him headlong into the pit of everlaſting deſtruction; he would not be amended, let him be condemned; he would not be humbled, let him therefore be damned: Thus conſcience delivers a ſinner into the hands of the jaylor, into the hands of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and then he is amazed and thinks himſelfe paſt hope, paſt help, paſt cure. This is that we ſhall obſerve in conſcience; look as it with a debter that liveth in priſon, he was haply put in at firſt for ſome trifle; when he is once there, then all his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors come in, and one layeth a hundred pound to him, and another a thouſand pound, and then his caſe is irrecoverable, he is never like to come out againe: ſo when conſcience hath arreſted a man, and caſt him into priſon for his pride, or for his covetouſneſſe, or for his drunkenneſſe, or for his adulterie and the like; then mark, Mercy, and Goodneſſe, and Patience, and Long-ſuffering come all in, and arreſt him, and Mercy ſaith, at my ſute ſoe many hundreds; Grace, that ſaith, at my ſute ſoe many thouſands; then Patience and Long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring comes and ſayes, at my ſute ſoe many millions; and this is the wofulleſt plight of all. When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is thus tormenting a ſinner, then patience comes and pleads againſt him, and mercy that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a bond againſt him. Mercy ſaith, Lord, I have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4393:137"/>beene wronged; then commeth grace and ſaith, Lord I have beene refuſed; then commeth pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſaith, Lord I have beene contemned; I have beſought him, ſaith mercy, to be reconciled but I was ſlighted; I have waited for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſayth patience, but I have not beene regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: I have beene offered, ſaith grace, but yet have beene neglected: Lord, all thy coſt and care hath beene deſpiſed; they all come before the Lord, and plead againſt the ſoule of a ſinner, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Lord, ſaith mercy, juſtice Lord ſaith grace, juſtice Lord, ſaith patience, wee have all beene ſlighted, neglected, and contemned: and then the Lord he condemnes him, and ſaith, take him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and execute vengeance upon him, mercy was offered but he refuſed, he would none of it, and therefore mercy ſhall never be ſhewed unto him, let him for ever be damned: And by this time the ſoule perceives it ſelfe to be in the divells hands, as it were, and in the divells poſſeſſion, and that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan may torment him as he pleaſe: and then the ſoule being thus perplexed, he cryeth out, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell is there, do you not ſee him, he is come for mee, and I ſhall go and muſt go with him: why, ſince I muſt go to the divell, why let mee go then; nay if the ſoule that is thus in the jawes of the divell, lie upon his death bed, as ſoone as ever he takes a little reſt, the Lord terrifieth and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him in his dreames, and then he riſeth out of his bed, and the firſt word hee ſpeaks is this, I muſt go, and I will go: then his friends that attend
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4393:137"/>about him, ask him whither he will go: they tell him he is among his friends, then he ſaith, I am damned, and I am going to hell, and therefore let mee go; the divell is comming to fetch mee, and therefore I muſt be gone. I beſeech you conſider this, you that make nothing of conſcience, if it once lay hold on you with this hook, it will hold you ſure enough, and reare your very hearts in peeces: Now when the Miniſter in ſent for to come unto apoore ſoule in this miſerable condition, when he comes haply he tells him, there is a great deale of mercy and comfort with the Lord, there is a great deale of grace and ſalvation with Chriſt; but then the ſinner, when he heares of mercy, is diſtracted and beſides himſelfe, and ſayes, that is my plague, that is my bane, and that in the end will be my damnation; if I had never heard of mercy, if I had not lived under the Goſpell, and the meanes of ſalvation, oh then I had been a happy man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, alas it is mercy that I have neglected, it is the glad tidings of ſalvation which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, how ſhall I then be ſaved; if the meanes of ſalvation have thus been ſlighted by mee; if I had never oppoſed grace, grace might now have helped mee; if I had not deſpiſed mercy, mercy might now have ſuccourd mee; but this is my plague, this is my woe, all the kindneſſe that God ſhewed to mee, and all the mercy that God hath revealed and offered, I have deſpiſed and refuſed: many a knock hath God given at my heart, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a rap at my ſoule, the Lord hath even wept over
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4393:138"/>mee as he did over <hi>Ieruſalem, oh that thou hadſt known the things belonging to thy peace:</hi> the Lord came kindly and wooed mee lovingly; oh the perſwaſions of the Lord, and commands of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that I have had, and yet after all perſwaſions and horror, and commands, what yet proud ſtill? what yet covetous ſtill? and prophane ſtill? why then ſurely there is no mercy to be looked for, no grace to be expected, and therefore certainly to hell I muſt go, and then he riſeth and will be gone to hell; all that are about him cannot hold him: but then the Miniſter haply further replyes; the truth of it is, you have done thus: but do you think ſo ſtill? would you do ſo ſtill, if you were out of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity? is it good now to be drunk? is it good now to commit adultery? is it good now to blaſpheme? is it good now to contemne Gods ordinances? would you now rayle on Gods Saints, and deſpiſe Gods truth, &amp; prophane Gods Sabbaths? would you now do theſe things? oh no, no, ſaith he, I now find what the end of thoſe wretched courſes will be the word of God could not prevayle with me, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter could not perſwade me, &amp; therefore now I ſhal periſh, I ſhall be damned for theſe abominations which I have committed, there is no remedy; if ever man ſhall be danmed, it is I; if ever man go downe to hell, ſurely it is I; nay, hell is too good for mee; oh the good Sermons that I have heard, the Miniſter hath ſpoken home oftentimes to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the very flames of hell have been flaſhed in my face, the Miniſter would often have ſpent
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4393:138"/>his bloud that he might doe good to my poore ſoule, and yet I deſpiſed the word, and ſcorned the Miniſter, and mocked thoſe whom conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vexed, ſaying; What, you are a man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are you? you dare not ſinne, your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not ſuffer you? what are you ſuch a foole to be ruled by your conſcience? and therefore God hath juſtly let my conſcience looſe upon me, now I know to my woe that I have a conſcience, the worme that never dieth gnaweth my heart, and rends and plucks my ſoule in peeces: woe, woe be unto mee, that ever I ſnufled my conſcience, that ever I put out the light of conſcience, for therefore is it that my conſcience is now thus tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my heart, and terrifying of my ſoule, here; and therefore it is that I ſhall for ever periſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But then the Miniſter he replyes, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; aye, the truth is, you have done thus, but you will not yet forſake your ſinnes, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your corruptions? will you ſtill be drunk and riotous? will you ſtill be proud? will you ſtill ſweare and curſe and blaſpheme? if you will part with theſe ſins, and take mercy in ſtead of theſe, why yet there is hope. Then the poore ſoule cryes out, now the Lord for his mercyes ſake remove theſe ſinnes from mee; oh I never had ſo much delight in my ſinnes heretofore, as now I have woe and miſery and vexation for them: Why here is a cup for a drunkard indeed, here is a cup for a whore indeed, here is a cup for a blaſphemer indeed, if every ſinners cup were filled thus brim full of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4393:139"/>Gods wrath, never any man would take any joy in be ing drunk more, never would any man take any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligt in chambring and wantonneſſe more: but then the poore ſoule ſayes further, oh but it is not in my power to help my ſoule, but if it will but pleaſe the Lord, to do good unto my poore ſoule, let him do what he will with it. What, faith the Miniſter, you are then willing and content to part with your ſinnes a yes, yes, ſaith the poore ſoule, I will rather offend all the world than God, I had as leiffe go to hell as to the committing of any ſinnefull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; well ſaith the Miniſter, if it be ſo, it is well, but do you ſpeak this from your heart; yes faith the poore ſoule, if it would pleaſe God to help me, I would forſake my ſins with all my heart. Why now the poore ſoule is comming againe, and God is haling of him aſide againe from his corruptions, and ſinfull diſtempers. This is that we ſhall obſerve. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. there ſaith the text, <hi>behold I will hedge up the way with thorns, and make a wall that ſhe ſhall not find her pathes, and ſhe ſhall follow after her lovers, but ſhe ſhall not overtake them, &amp; ſhe ſhall ſeek them but ſhe ſhall not find them: then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and return to my firſt husband, for it was better with mee then, than it is now.</hi> The Lord at laſt teares the ſoule and rends the heart from ſinfull diſtempers, and then the ſoule thinketh, oh there is not that pleaſure in ſinne, as I have formerly thought there was, the ſoule then hateth drunkenneſſe as death, he is not able to look upon his adultereſſe queane, he is not able to abide the houſe where he committed the folly, &amp; his heart
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4393:139"/>beginnes to tremble at it. And therefore mark the next and laſt cord: I ſhould have added more to the former poynt out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.16. there ſaith <hi>David, thy fierce wrath is gone over mee, and thy terrours have cut mee off; thine arrowes ſtick faſt in mee;</hi> how ever <hi>David</hi> before had ſhook off the commands and accuſations of conſcience, though theſe would not draw him to God; yet now the Lords arrowes ſtuck faſt in him, he could not pluck them out, nor caſt them off for his life. The laſt cord is the cord of the Spirit, the Lord by the almighty power of his ſpirit, when the ſoule is thus looſened, he then fully plucks it to himſelfe, never againe to be ſodered and cloſed unto corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; with an almighty hand he cuts the ſoule off from ſinne, and takes it into his own hand, that it may never be muſtered by ſinne, and Satan any more as it was formerly. Look as it is with a graft, a man muſt pluck it by force from one ſtock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can plant it upon another; ſo the Lord by the ſpirit of power doth rend the ſoule from ſinne, and ingrafteth it into Chriſt, and now the ſoule purpoſeth never to commit any ſinne againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.11. there Chriſt ſaith, that he will ſend the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the <hi>Comforter, and he ſhall reprove the world of righteouſneſſe, and of ſinne, and of judgement:</hi> In that it is ſaid, he will reprove the world of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thereby is nothing elſe meant, but that the Lord will govern men; and why ſhall the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter convince the world of judgement? becauſe Satan is judged, ſaith the text; that is, he is kept off
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4393:140"/>and cannot pluck the ſoule to himſelfe, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that Satan had over the ſoule, is wholly removed, and Chriſt hath the ſoule under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the ſoule is contented to be wholly at at his diſpoſing. In the time that Chriſt lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, when the divells did poſſeſſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men, the Lord ſaith unto them, I charge thee thou uncleane ſpirit to come out; ſo the Lord ſaith now to the divell that hath taken poſſeſſion of the ſoules of thoſe men, which do belong to the election of grace; after the Lord hath rent a poore ſinner from his corruptions, and haled him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then he ſaith, come out of him Satan, and never rule him more, never take place in him more; and then he takes the ſoule into his hands, that he may governe him, and diſpoſe of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne good will and pleaſure. This wee ſee the cords, whereby God draweth a ſinner to himſelfe. Firſt he inlightens the mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales to the ſoule of a ſinner, that he is in a wrong way, and that he muſt take another courſe if ever he meane to come at heaven, and then the layes the cords of mercy, and the cords of conſcience upon him, whereby he conſtraines and forces him to come unto him, and the laſt is the cord of the Spirit, whereby he doth take the ſoule out of the hands of Satan, into his owne poſſeſſion. The next thing to be conſidered, is, the reaſons why the Lord by a holy kind of violence,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſons, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </note> thus drawes a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from corruption to himſelfe, &amp; the arguments are three. The firſt is taken from thoſe tear me
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4393:140"/>whereby the Scripture diſcovereth this work of God, upon the ſoule of a ſinner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.29. there ſaith our Saviour, <hi>No man commeth into a ſtrong mans houſe, but firſt he overcomes, and binds the ſtrong man before he takes poſſeſſion of his houſe, and ſpoyles his goods:</hi> this is the parable; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, the houſe is nothing elſe but the heart of a ſinner, the ſtrongman is nothing elſe but ſinne and Satan, the divell and ſinne taking poſſeſſion of, and ruling in the ſoule of a ſinner; (and this is the wofull condition of many men, that think their penny good ſilver, and beare their heads aloft, howſoever they lift their heads ſo high, yet their ſoules are nothing elſe but habitations for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,) now Satan ruling, and overpowering the ſoule by ſinne, is the ſtrong man, that uſurps autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the ſoule, by reaſon of the corruptions that prevayle over the ſoule, (for if there were not ſinne within the ſoules of men, there were no power that Satan could uſurp over men:) now obſerve it, the Lord Ieſus is the ſtronger man, and before he can come, and take poſſeſſion of the ſoule, and work effectually in the ſoule, he muſt bind Satan, and take away the weapons of Satan, and then when he hath bound him, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, then he takes poſſeſſion of the ſoule; this is the meaning of the parable: Now I reaſon thus, conquering, binding, and ſlaying, imply a kind of violence; Satan will not come out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, the devill muſt be commanded to go out, or elſe drawn out by a kind of violence: if all the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4393:141"/>Angells in heaven, and all the men on earth ſhould intreat Satan to come out of the ſoule, he would not come out, but this implyeth a holy kind of violence, that Chriſt offereth to corruptions in the ſoule, when he drawes the ſoule from ſinne to himſelfe. In another place it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt came to deſtroy the works of the divell, Ioh.</hi> 3.8. thoſe works are the ſinfull corruptions, that were at firſt put into the ſoule by the deluſion of Satan, when he tempted our firſt parents to eat of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit: Now Chriſt commeth to deſtroy thoſe works, now the works of Satan will not deſtroy themſelves, ſinne and Satan will not bind and overcome themſelves, the enemy will not come out of his hold willingly, but the work that muſt be put forth for the binding, conquering, and deſtroying of thoſe, muſt needs imply a work of conſtraint, and holy violence which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. A man offers violence to his enemy when he binds him, a man offers violence to his enemy, when he overcomes him, a man offers violence to his enemy, when he flayes and deſtroyes him: ſuch is the work of the Lord, when he takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a ſoule this way, and this is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Divines in this caſe: they ſay, that the Lord doth take away that deadneſſe, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of heart, whereby it may lay hold on grace, if it reſiſt not the good motions of the Spirit.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4393:141"/>from a naturall ſubject, by conſtraint and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but the ſpirit, as a contrary, doth drive out ſinne from the ſoule, in the work of preparation, as a contrary thereunto: and therefore muſt do it by conſtraynt and compulſion. Wee will open both the parts of the Argument; I ſay, one contrary driveth out another, by violence and conſtraynt; as for example, whereſoever heat is, if it commeth to drive out cold, it doth it by a certaine kind of violence, for the ground of all conſtraint, ariſeth from the croſſeneſſe and contrariety that things have one to another; wee need no conſtraint to to make things doe that which is naturall unto them, as to make fire hot, or a Lyon fierce, or a Wolfe ravenous; but he that will make a Lyon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Lamb, and he that will make a wolfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Kidd, he that doth this, muſt offer a kind of violence to the nature of the Lyon, and of the Wolfe, and break the combination that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the fierceneſſe of the thing, and the thing it ſelfe; ſo that it is cleare, that one contrary driveth out another, from a naturall ſubject, by conſtraint and violence; and that ſinne is naturally in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart, is evident <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>whatſoever is born of the fleſh, is fleſh;</hi> that is, whoſoever commeth from <hi>Adam,</hi> is rooted in ſinne: now mark, ſinne being thus naturally in the ſoule, the Spirit of grace, and the Lord Ieſus, when he commeth to drive away ſinne from the ſoule, breaketh that neere union that is between ſinne and the ſoule, by a holy kind of violence; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.17. there ſaith the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4393:142"/>Apoſtle, <hi>from henceforth let no man trouble mee, for I beare in my body the marks of the Lord Ieſue;</hi> the Lord Ieſus breaking this naturall, and neare union, between ſinne and the ſoule, muſt offer a kind of violence upon the ſoule, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this union could not be parted. To ſpeak punctually to every ones capacity, I appeale to any here preſent: is it not a violence, to pluck a branch from the tree, or an arme from the body? every man will ſay, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>are and pluck it: the arme naturally is knit to the body, and the branch naturally growes to the tree; our ſinnes are as arme to the body, and our corruptions as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the tree, therefore the Lord Ieſus when he comes to pluck off theſe armes, and cut off thoſe branches, muſt offer a kind of violence to the ſoule, before this union and combination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſinne and the ſoule, will be parted and broken, this is the ſecond reaſon, if there be ſuch a naturall neare union, betweene ſinne and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart, then if God will pluck corruption from the ſoule, and ſever this union, he muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a kind of violence, but there is a naturall neere union, and league betweene ſinne and the ſoule, and therefore the Lord muſt diſſolve this league, and breake this union, by a kind of violence, and conſtraint.</p>
               <p>The third, and laſt argument is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The third Argument.</hi>
                  </note> As in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that union that is betweene the ſoule and ſinne, the ſoule muſt by a holy kind of violence, be drawn from ſinne; ſo alſo in the ſecond place, if
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4393:142"/>wee conſider that ſoveraigne kind of power that ſinne hath over the ſoule, and prevaileth within the ſoule, (which kind of reſiſtance and ſoveraign command muſt be drawne away, and removed from the ſoule,) we ſhall ſee that this cannot be done, unleſſe there be an almighty hand, to work this, and offer a kind of conquering, and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence upon the ſoule: in this caſe, the ſoveraigne rule that ſinne doth exerciſe in the ſoule is ſuch, that unleſſe the Lord by his almighty hand, doth overpower this, there is no kind of prevailing, in the ſoule of a ſinner in this caſe: now to ſhew how the Lord Ieſus doth overpower the ſtrength of ſinne and corruption, obſerve it in two particulars, how the Lord Ieſus is pleaſed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, to overpower that rule which ſinne hath over the ſoule; the firſt is this: The ſoule of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being wholly poſſeſſed with, and defiled by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, is ſo farre carried againſt God, that it doth nothing but reſiſt againſt God; it is naturally ſo farre overwhelmed and poſſeſſed with ſinne in every kind, that it doth nothing but reſiſt; nay it can do nothing but reſiſt the work of the ſpirit, it beateth back the work of the ſpirit, that it may not work upon it, nor take place in it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.31. there ſaith the text, <hi>oh generation, ſee yee the word of the Lord, have I been a wilderneſſe unto Iſrael, a land of darkneſſe, wherefore ſay my people, we are Lords, we will come no more unto thee?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, do you think to rule us, or do you think that your commands ſhall take place with us, no no, our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4393:143"/>corruptions are our Lords; wee will come at you no more, we will neither heare your words, nor obey your commands in this kind. Secondly, when the ſoule doth nothing but reſiſt, when the Lord would work upon the heart, when the ſoule beateth back the work of the Spirit, and doth nothing, nay can do nothing, but reſiſt the Lord Ieſus, the Lord Ieſus then takes away that ſtony heart, he gives us a fleſhy heart, whereby we may lay hold on the meanes, and be fitted to receive the good motions of the Spirit. There is an old phraſe, which Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> propounded in his time, and Divines take it up with one conſent in this caſe, and that is this, <hi>that God of an unwilling will, doth make a willing will;</hi> the word being truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, I deſire no more for the work in hand, which implyeth a holy kind of violence, to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thereunto, and expreſſed thereupon, before the work can be brought to paſſe. For the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poynt, obſerve theſe particulars, in the ſentence before ſpoken of, that I may ſpeak punctually, and preciſely; firſt, the ſoule of a man naturally, is altogether unwilling to receive grace; ſecondly, that the Lord doth bring willingneſſe out of this unwillingneſſe, as light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; thirdly, that God muſt take away this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe, before he can bring willingneſſe into the ſoule; laſtly (wherein lieth the ſtrength of the poynt) the Lord he only muſt do this; unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will not deſtroy it ſelfe, the ſoule is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt, corruption will not deſtroy it ſelfe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4393:143"/>and therefore there is nothing elſe in the ſoule of a ſinner, but only the Almighty hand of God and his conquering power that muſt take away this unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, and put willingneſſe into the ſoule: The Text ſaith in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. that <hi>God bringeth light out of darkneſſe:</hi> how muſt he do this? why he muſt firſt deſtroy darkneſſe, before he can bring light out of it: for one contrary cannot make up another, both remaining, but darkneſſe muſt be deſtroyed before light can be brought forth: So it is with the ſoule, God brings willingneſſe out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe; firſt therefore he muſt deſtroy this unwillingneſſe, he muſt deſtroy that darkneſſe that is in the ſoule before he can bring willingneſſe, and light to the ſoule; he muſt conquer that reſiſtance againſt the Spirit which is in the ſoule, before he can make it plyable and frameable to his owne will and pleaſure. It is a pretty paſſage, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. there <hi>Paul</hi> went into the field againſt Chriſt, and pitched a combate betweene Chriſt and him, he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten letters from the Synagogue of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and hee was reſolutely bent to kill and ſlay all poore Chriſtians: when he came, the Lord Ieſus met him by the way, and there was a fight betweene the Lord and <hi>Paul,</hi> and in all reaſon he was reſolved to fight againſt God, to try it out to the laſt; now the Lord met him, and the battell was fought, and the Lord Chriſt overcame him, and what followeth, inſtead of fierce reſiſting the Lord, hee comes to ſubmit himſelfe humbly to the Lord, he doth not only put off the act of reſiſting, but the will of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4393:144"/>alſo, as we may ſee, verſ. 6. there ſaith the text, <hi>he trembling and aſtoniſhed ſaid, Lord what wilt thou have me for to doe?</hi> Saul, Saul, <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</hi> Why Lord, ſaith he, what wilt thou have me to do? <hi>Paul</hi> was not willing to take up his owne heart, for that was madd againſt the Lord, but he did ſubmit himſelfe and his will unto Chriſt. Briefly then to gather up the point: if it be ſo, that the Lord doth deſtroy and bind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Satan, if the Lord break that naturall union and combination that is betweene ſinne and the ſoule, if it be ſo that the Lord by his almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and conquering hand doth overcome the power of ſinne in the ſoule, then the Lord by a holy kind of violence doth pluck the ſoule from ſinne, and draw it to himſelfe; but all the former have beene prooved, it is ſinne and Satan which God binds and overcomes, it is that neere union betweene ſinne and the ſoule that God breaketh, it is the power that ſinne hath over the ſoule that God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, God takes away not only the act, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of reſiſting from the ſouſe, and therefore there muſt be ſome conſtraining power that muſt work this in the ſoule. We will now proceed to the uſe of this point.</p>

Is this the work of the Lord that hee doth by an holy kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4393:146"/>draw a ſinner from corruption to himſelfe, out of the bowells of his compaſſion? what then ſhall we think and judge of thoſe men, that uſe all meanes, and all ſlights; that employ their wits to draw ſinners from God, to ſinne? is it Gods great work, his Maſter-piece; the greateſt good that hee intends for his people, to pluck them from their corruptions, and draw them to himſelfe? what then wil become of thoſe men that go profeſſedly againſt God, and oppoſe the work of God in this kind: if there be any ſuch perſons here, as I doubt there are many ſuch in the congregation; I tell you, if God be an holy God, then thou art an unholy man; if God bee mercifull to poore ſinners to ſave them, then thou art cruell to damne them; if God bee a gracious God, and would draw poore ſinners from ſinne unto himſelfe, then thou art a graceleſſe man, and in a miſerable condition, that wouldſt draw poore ſoules from God to hell; and yet do no our townes ſwarme with ſuch wretches? and are not our villages peſtered with ſuch ungracious miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? ſuch as the wiſe man in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>that eat the bread of wickedneſſe, and drink the bloud of violence, and they cannot ſleep unleſſe they cauſe ſome to fall;</hi> the God of heaven open theſe mens eyes, and awaken their conſciences that they may ſee their wretched eſtate; ſuch as eat the bread of wickedneſſe and drink the wine of violence, unleſſe they can get ſuch a man to bee drunk with them, and ſuch a woman to play the whore with them, and ſuch a fellow to couzen and cheat, their

               <p>I will therefore diſcover theſe two things, firſt, the cunning of men in this courſe; ſecondly, the miſerable condition that they are in, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this courſe; I take it they are in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4393:147"/>moſt wofull, and wretched eſtate of any men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven. Firſt, to ſee the cunning of ſinners in this kind, they will work upon the heart, and draw the ſoule, and cut Gods cords, and break Gods bonds, that God may not draw a poore ſinner from ſinne to himſelfe, they have a cord for a cord, and a hook for a hook, in this kind: Firſt, if God let in the light of knowledge into the underſtanding of a poore ſinner, a young man perhaps receiveth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by the word, that hee is not in the right way; the ſpirit that calls after him and tells him he is wrong, and ſaies, this is the good ancient way, walk in it: when the Lord lets in the light thus into the ſoule of a ſinner, and reveales the good way to him; when the Lord thus turneth a man out of the mouth of the Lyon, and paw of the Beare, then happily he goes into a corner and mournes for his ſinnes, and reſolves to forſake them, hee will not keep company with his old companions, but ſeeks God alwayes, and prayes to God continually. Now mark what hooks they apply to pull him off from this good courſe, they uſe a company of carnall reaſons to perſwade him to the contrary; when the maſter, father, or husband, ſeeth that God is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wife, or his ſervant, or his child unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, why then the towne is in an uproare, as if there were ſome fire in the towne: mark what the husband ſaies, my wife was wont to be carefull to go about her buſineſſe, but now ſhee leaves all at ſix and ſeven, and is ſo preciſe, that ſhe is alwayes praying or poring upon a booke. The child, hee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4393:148"/>thinks his father diſtracted; his father perhaps gives him a ſtrict charge not to prophane the Sabbath any more, no more gaming now ſirra, no more ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, the child wonders at this, and ſtands ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; he admires what is become of his father, hee was wont to ſuffer him to do theſe things without any controulment, and becauſe now he commands him the contrary, he thinks his father is out of the right way. And as the child is to the father, ſo is the father to the child; if the underſtanding of the child be enlightned, and he be creeping to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if hee will not do as he did in former times, if hee will not runne on in thoſe wicked practiſes which hee did before, then the father thinks his ſonne is undone, his ſonne was wont to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and hee was wont to have ſervice from him, but now hee is growne ſo curious and exact, that he expects no goodneſſe from him, hee can look for nothing to be done by him, I now give him over for loſt: and as their hearts are thus trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſo they pluck with a kind of violence from God, as God plucks to himſelfe, ſo they labour to pluck a poore ſoule from God, and they begin to chide, &amp; taunt, and chafe, and brawle: what ſay they, will you alwayes be reading, and will you alwayes be praying? I warrant, you think your mother and I are not in the right way, becauſe we doe not as you doe, you thought heretofore ſuch a man to be an honeſt man and your friend alſo, and yet hee doth not do thus as you do, nor you your ſelfe were not wont to do thus in former times neither. Thus
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4393:148"/>mark what cords they lay upon a man that hath beene enlightned: the child happily replyeth, alas father, when I knew no other, I muſt confeſſe, I did no better; but when the Lord hath once given us the truth, let us walke in it, I muſt follow the example of no man in this kind; the Miniſter told me that there was no expectation of mercy unleſſe I turned from my ſinnes, the text was plaine, and the Miniſter ſaid, that we muſt walk in Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements here, if ever we meane to reigne with him in glory hereafter. Oh then ſaith the father, I would the Miniſter had beene farre enough off, when hee put this into your head: and if hee ſee that this will not prevaile with the child, then hee ſets another upon him, hee ſends his carnall friends after him; he ſets a carnall goſpeller one that hath beene <hi>twice dead, and pluckt up by the roots,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeakes upon him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iude</hi> 12.</note> and he bids him ſee what he can do in this caſe, and then he comes and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with him with all the carnall counſell and wicked devices that can bee invented: and marke how he ſets upon him, Friend, ſaith he, I heare you attend upon the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, I am very glad to heare it, but yet be wary and wiſe though, too much, is too much in this caſe, your head is not yet gray; if you had had the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that I have, you would then perhaps know as much as I know: be wiſe I ſay in this kind; but I pray underſtand me aright, I do not ſpeak againſt holineſſe all this while, I beſeech you do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me ſo, for I am glad with all my heart that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4393:149"/>there is ſuch a change wrought in you, and that you take up ſuch a good courſe, but this is that I ſay; Be religious and wiſe both together; bleſſed be God my friend, we have a glorious Church, many wiſe men, and yet they require not ſo much, and they performe not ſo much, they will drink and bee merry, and why ſhould you exact more than theſe wiſe men? aye but, replyeth the child, I cannot tell what wiſe men ſay, and what they do, I muſt not do as they do, but as God commands; the Text ſaith, <hi>Be yee holy, as I am holy; and bee yee pure, as Chriſt is pure,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.3. can a man be more holy than Chriſt, can a man be more pure than Chriſt in this caſe? I know not what men do, but I am ſure the word gives no ſuch allowance: and now they think the matter is paſt hope, when carnall counſell cannot prevaile, nor curſed devices take place, then they think the matter is paſt cure, and therefore they purſue him with deadly indignation, they put ſuch taunts upon him, and follow him with ſuch ſcoffes, that the heart of the poore creature is even wearied and tyred, and ſo departs from his God and all good courſes, and ſo hee falls into wicked courſes againe, and runnes downe headlong into hell. And this is one cord which the wicked, the devills factors lay upon a poore ſinner to pluck him from God; you that are guilty of this, you muſt ſee into theſe things, and be humbled for this, or elſe you muſt look to ſuffer that judgement which is due to the commiſſion of this ſinne; you muſt know you go profeſſely againſt the Lord, and therefore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4393:149"/>you muſt needs bee in a miſerable condition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if this cord be broken, then the Lord hath another cord, the Lord makes a ſinner apprehend the mercy of God, hee heares the Miniſter how he ſpeaks of Gods wonderfull love and goodneſſe, in that he will not only accept poore ſinners and entertaine them when they come, but command them to come; and not only ſo, but intreates and beſeeches them to come and receive mercy from him, nay hee waites for our amendment and cryes out, oh when will it once bee, and when a poore ſinner heares this, this even melts his heart, and he reſolves never to follow his ſinnes more, and then he comes home and tells his father or his maſter what wonderfull goodneſſe God hath beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make knowne unto him. I, ſaith hee, could not have thought ſo much, I could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo much: what, that God ſhould ſtoope to man, and majeſty to miſery? that God ſhould not only offer grace, and give a ſinner leave to take grace, but that God ſhould follow ſuch a wretch as I am with mercy, and intreat mee to bee ſaved? what admirable and wonderfull goodneſſe is this! Father, or maſter, ſhall I be ſo unnaturall as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this mercy and kindneſſe? oh let it never bee for the Lord Ieſus ſake. Thus the father or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſeeth his child or his ſervant going away from his evill courſes which he had formerly taken up, the father feeles which way the child is going, and he followes after him amaine, and labours to pluck away this cord with another, and therefore thus
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4393:150"/>he anſwereth; It is true indeed, there is a great deale of mercy, endleſſe, boundleſſe mercy with the Lord, therefore let us make uſe of this mercy, ſonne; and let us take this goodneſſe, ſervant: in this caſe, the Lord will not onely provide for the good of our ſoules, but for the good of our bodies alſo: as the Lord requireth that wee ſhould performe ſervice to him, ſo hee requireth alſo that we ſhould have a care of our owne eſtates, and therefore take heed of growing into too nice a courſe; bee not too extreame this way, for the Lord doth not require ſuch exactneſſe of you, that thereby you ſhould impoveriſh your eſtate: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore of too much preciſeneſſe I ſay, leſt you bring thereby diſgrace to your ſelfe, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to your eſtate, and hazzard to your life: the Lord promiſeth to proſper whatſoever wee take in hand, and therefore this nice courſe is not that which God requireth, and by this means the poore child or ſervant is daunted and deluded, and ſo falls off from his good purpoſes and reſolutions. Thus thoſe two cords are broken: the Lord hath yet a third cord, and that is the cord of conſcience, which hee layes upon a man, and that commands him to take heed of his corruptions, and tells him, he was wont to be gibing at Gods ſervants, but take heed of theſe things, all at the laſt day muſt bee brought to light; now this makes the ſoule at a ſtand: and then the man ſaith, the word of God came home to my conſcience, for I have beene a drunkard, and an adulterer, and a ſwearer; oh I ſaw
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4393:150"/>the fearefull eſtate of thoſe men; the Miniſter came effectually home to my conſcience, and told mee what a miſerable wretched condition I ſhould be in, if I continued in my former wicked courſes. Now marke the cord that they lay to draw this away, they lay a diſgrace and contempt upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; when (ſay they) did you take notice of your conſcience? will you be one of our tender conſcienced people? what your conſcience trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled you, did it? what will you be ſo ſimple? will you be ſuch a foole to ſhake at the word of a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? alas, alas, it is not conſcience, it is but conceit in this caſe: and ſo at laſt the poore ſinner falls off againe by the inticements of Satan, and carnall counſells of wicked men, and at laſt the Lord lets in horror, and anguiſh, and vexation into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſets the very flaſhes of hell fire upon his face, and now ſcoffes and ſcornes will not ſerve the turne, for the poore ſoule ſaith, Now I find that it was not conceit that troubled mee, for the flaſhes of hell have beene in my face; and all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt God and his truth, all the taunts and ſcoffes againſt God and his ſervants, and all my abominations that ever I committed, I tell you, I ſaw them all ſet before me, and I ſaw hell open in concluſion, and God executing judgement upon me for my ſinnes. Now when his companions ſee him in this humour, they think a ſcoffe will not chaſe away this horrour, for he tells them, it is not your ſcoffes that will do it now; no, no, I am going to hell, and you will follow after me as faſt as may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4393:151"/>be, you haled me to drunkenneſſe, and adultery, and other baſe courſes; you drew me to ungodly practiſes, and therefore you ſhall to hell as well as I, do you think that I ſhall goe to hell, and you not make haſte after me? do you think that I ſhall bee damned, and you not be plagued? when his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſee this, then they leave ſcoffing and gibing of him, and dare not appeare themſelves, but the devill hee transformes himſelfe into an angell of light; a drunkard will not now come unto him in the coate of a drunkard, but he takes the coate of ſome ſeeming grave man upon him, and hee muſt ſet upon him, and tell him how the caſe ſtands: and this carnall man doth three things to draw away the heart from God, in this kind firſt he deludes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and tels him there is ſuch a thing in feare, but nothing in deed, thou, ſaith he, art ſinfull, and God is mercifull, thou haſt beene an adulterer, ſo was <hi>David,</hi> and hee did nothing, but ſay, I have ſinned, and he was forgiven: oh but ſaith the poore ſoule, <hi>David</hi> was a broken hearted man, and this broke his very bones. Well, when he ſeeth this will not do, then ſecondly, he muſt get him to cards, and to dice, to ſports and to playes, untill his conſcience be benumed and ſeared, and then thirdly all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be kept from him in theſe caſes; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they will be ſure that he doth not look upon a Bible, leſt by that meanes hee might bee drawne away againe. Now the Lord be mercifull unto us; the poore man by counſell on one ſide, and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the other; whereas before his ſoule was a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4393:151"/>little inlightned and his conſcience awakened, now he begins to turne a devill, he flies about as though hell were broken looſe, he cares not what he doth for the diſhonouring of God, and damning of his owne ſoule, ſo that by this time you ſee the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of men in this kind: Will you now know the condition of theſe men, I tell you, if there bee any wretched, miſerable, wofull, accurſed, damned people in the world, I cannot tell who they be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe be they, and therefore obſerve the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of their condition in three reſpects; firſt, they are moſt like the devill; ſecondly, they are moſt oppoſite to God; thirdly, they are the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to mens ſalvation: firſt, they that oppoſe this worke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4393:153"/>that hee may devoure it; ſo it is with wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that beare the image and exerciſe the practiſe of the divell, if there be any that God is pleaſed to work upon, why wicked men they court them at all times and occaſions that can be, all is too good for them in this kind; niceneſſe, and exactneſſe, and preciſeneſſe, and madneſſe, and all is caſt upon them to devoure poore ſinners, and hinder poore Saints, to hinder the birth of the child, that the Church travelleth withall; why wouldſt thou devoure a poore creature that God in mercy would deliver from ſinne here, and bring to ſalvation hereafter? Doſt thou envy him, doſt thou by curſed perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and wicked devices endeavour to pluck from God to ſinne; I tell thee, if there were ever a divell in a man, there is one in thee; if there were ever a child of the divell, that was wicked here, and ſhall be damned hereafter, thou art ſurely one: and this is the firſt thing wherein the miſerable condition of theſe men is diſcovered; they are the children of the divell, the Lord of heaven open your eyes, and awaken your conſciences, and reveale theſe things to your ſoules, that you may forſake theſe baſe courſes; ſecondly, as they are moſt like to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, ſo alſo their wretched eſtate appeares in this, that they are the greateſt and deadlieſt enemies to God, that place formerly named will ſerve for the opening of this, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.10. there ſaith the Text, <hi>thou child of the divell, and enemy to all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Paul</hi> calls <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer, becauſe hee withſtood him, and reſiſted the work of God, not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4393:153"/>only the child of the divell, but an enemy to all righteouſneſſe; mark that, as who ſhould ſay, he that withholds a Saint of God, hee that would pluck a ſoule from walking uprightly before God, he is an enemy to all righteouſneſſe, and this is a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing; for other kind of ſinnes are of a leſſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for a drankard is an enemy to ſobriety, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt perſon is an enemy to juſtice, a lyer is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to truth, an adulterer is an enemy to chaſtity, and a malicious man is an enemy to charity; but he that is an enemy to the ſaving work of Gods grace in the ſoule of a man, he that withſtands and reſiſts the worke of converſion, hee is an enemy to all righteouſneſſe; for how ſhall a man walk holily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or righteouſly before his brethren, how ſhall he love God above all things, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelfe, unleſſe grace be wrought in the ſoule of a man, and unleſſe the word of God bee placed in the heart of a man: men ought to keep Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements that they may receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from God; now unleſſe God beſtow faith, and grace, and his ſpirit upon a man, how ſhall hee do this; but when thou ſayeſt, I would not have ſuch a man converted, I would not have the ſpirit work effectually in his heart; when thou hindereſt the work of God in this kind, then thou hindereſt a man from performing obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and therefore thou art an enemy to God; Gods Sabbaths can never be ſanctified, the life of thy neighbour can never be tendered, the chaſtity of thy neighbour can never be preſerved;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4393:154"/>thou art a drunkard, thou art an adulterer, thou are a murtherer, he that murthereth a man, is an enemy to the life of a man, but he that will not ſuffer the word of God to take plane in the ſoule of a ſinner, he is the murtherer of the ſoule of a man, he is an enemy to all righteouſneſſe, he cannot performe, any ſervice unto God; there is no duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, no ſinne to bee omitted, but thou art an enemy to all, for when thou doſt hinder a ſinner from receiving of grace, and from being made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker thereof, thou doſt hinder a ſinner from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God here, and receiving of comfort hereafter, and what a wofull wretched condition is this to be an enemy to all righteouſneſſe, and not only ſo, but full of all miſchiefe, for ſo ſaith the Text aforenamed; thou enemy of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and full of all miſchiefe, marke the opening of the words; full, that is, brimme full, top full, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to runne over with wickedneſſe, and the cauſe is this; its naught for a man to be wicked, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be no better, is worſe; but for a man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wicked, and reſolve to be no better, but to hinder others alſo from being good, this is the very height of all impiety, this is to be an enemy to all righteouſneſſe, and to be full of miſchiefe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they are the children of the divell, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all righteouſneſſe, ſo alſo they are the greateſt enemies to the ſalvation of mens ſoules; they compaſſe ſea and land to make a Proſelyte: I beſeech you take notice of it, thou art a drunkard and a blaſphemer, and a wretched lewd perſon, thou
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4393:154"/>art not only bad thy ſelfe, but ſuch a man hath had his mind inlightned and his conſcience awakened, but thou by thy wicked counſells and carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſinfull arguments catcheſt him, and with, draweſt him againe into his former wicked courſes and baſe practiſes, and then the end of that man is worſe than the beginning, and hee becomes twice a child of the divell; well, he ſhall periſh, and ſo ſhalt thou, he ſhall be damned, but the Lord ſhall require his bloud at thy hands; and this is the maine cauſe why men periſh and go downe to hell: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the wicked counſells and curſed perſwaſions which ſinfull damned perſons uſe to hurry poore ſoules downe into deſtruction, as though they could not go faſt enough of themſelves to hell, but they muſt lay theſe baſe ſinfull cords upon them, to draw them headlong into the bottomleſſe pit of confuſion. Well, the time will come, when theſe poore creatures ſhall call for vengeance at the hand of God to bee executed againſt you; they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you at the laſt day, and curſe you, and call for vengeance to be poured downe upon your heads; you that are guilty of this, whenſoever you meet with the day of death here, or with the day of judgement hereafter, then it will go marvellous heavily with you; you have hindred the worke of converſion for being wrought in them, and you have drawne them into wicked courſes; they ſhall go to hell, they ſhall periſh poore ſoules, but I tell you, their blood will God require at your hands, at that day they will appeare before the Lord of

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4393:155"/>and terrified mee, and pluckt mee aſide from this good courſe; good Lord revenge my bloud at my Land-lords hand, the ſervant he will ſay; Lord, there was a gracious fellow ſervant lived in the houſe with me, and did me much good, I loved to heare thy word, and pray, and read, and performe good duties, but good Lord, it was the ſharp reproofes and bitter taunts of my maſter that diſcouraged me, and made me forſake my former courſe; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I muſt go to hell, but Lord though I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yet I beſeech thee revenge my bloud at my maſters hands. Many of you have wives that lie in your boſomes, in whoſe hearts the word of God hath begun to take place, and they have reſolved to walk uprightly before God; they have gone and mourned in ſecret, and ſighed to heaven, but it is you that are their husbands which have hindered this gracious diſpoſition, and you thought your ſelves undone becauſe your wives took this courſe, and therefore you never left brawling, and bayting, and rayling, untill your poore wives left all, left praying, and left reading, and left all goodneſſe; I tell you, thoſe wives that now lie in your boſomes, though they love you now, the time will come when they will curſe the day that ever they ſaw or knew you; what a wofull caſe will it be at the day of judgement, when the wife ſhall come before the Lord and ſay, I confeſſe Lord, I enjoyed thy word, and it was brought home to my ſoule, and it wrought upon my conſcience, and I had a full purpoſe to become a new creature, and take a new courſe; I

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4393:156"/>hearts to take heed of drawing away poore ſinners from God; if it were in my power, I would not only perſwade you, but overcome you in this kind; if it were in my power to ſave you, I would give ſalvation unto you; but alas, it is not in my power, and indeed it is pitty it ſhould; it is the Lord that muſt do it; you that have heard this word, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you let it not fall to the ground; but all you ſcorners and mockers at Gods Saints, you that have drawne men out of the right way, and out of a good courſe, for the Lords ſake, and for mercies ſake, and for your owne poore ſoules ſake, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never againe to draw away poore ſinners from that courſe wherein they walke; but when you ſee them going on well, why then goe you along with them, and if you ſee any lay cords up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to draw them away, helpe them, you in this kind, and labour to draw them backe againe.</p>
